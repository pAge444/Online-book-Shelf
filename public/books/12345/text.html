  <h2 id="chp1" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Chapter One</h2>
  <p class = "para1" id="4" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  The day I learnt I was a demon was the worst day of my life. I won't lie. I spent most the day <br>
  terrified of dying, or losing a limb.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="5" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The first thing I heard, and thought about when I woke that morning was of demons. A were-cat <br>
  scream echoed for a beat, before an answering scream, higher in pitch called in the distance. It <br>
  sounded like the packs were fighting; a territorial dispute most likely. There was a Pride not too <br>
  far from the Temple. A muffled shriek drifted up through the floorboards, and I rolled my eyes when <br>
  it happened on the next scream. I buried my head under the pillow, pulling my blanket up. New <br>
  Disciple's thought the world was ending every time a demon passed nearby. It took them long to <br>
  understand, if the Wall was breached the klaxon went off to warn us.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="6" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I rolled out of bed, tripped over the mountains of fabric and crushed cans that littered the floor <br>
  of my room, and head butted the wardrobe door. It bounced back. Clothes flung over the top and <br>
  spilling out the bottom had stopped it from clicking shut. I was not a dirty person, but a messy <br>
  one. I was the kind of person who could make mess in an empty four by ten box. Stood in my fraying <br>
  bra and panties, I groggily scratched at my knee, trying to pull myself together. It took a lot of <br>
  rummaging around before I pulled on my ragged jeans and faded tee shirt, some pre Rupture band on <br>
  the front. Not the best gear for running, but I was going to have to go straight to class <br>
  afterwards. I put my boots on and headed outside.<br>
  It was dark. Dawn was hours away, and the grounds were eerily quiet. Fire drums set alongside the <br>
  pathway flickered, and weak flames cast a sick flush over the cold ground. Electricity was hard to <br>
  generate, so the Sect cut corners where it could. Resources during the day, and after dark, <br>
  focused on Wall hotspots, places difficult for the Clerics to easily defend, like steep ravines <br>
  and cliff faces. These were the places demons too often breached. My eyes skipped over the Temple <br>
  grounds, and every graffiti wall, battered trashcan was colored fondly in my mind's eye. The <br>
  Temple was an army base, before the Rupture, but now it was the stomping ground of the Sect <br>
  Clerics and their Disciples. It was home. Safety. My eyes settled on the Wall in the near <br>
  distance, peeking out from the forest bordering the region. Past that electric fence was Outside. <br>
  Past that fence roamed the demons.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="7" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="8" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I started at a jog. In no time I was at the main gate whistling to the security guard who barely <br>
  looked up from his book. I wondered where he'd gotten that. Books made purely for entertainment <br>
  were as rare as plain paper. The Sect had a library of course, right here at Temple, but you had to <br>
  have serious pull with the Priests to be able to rent one. We lucky Disciples got to feel the <br>
  smooth pages of a book on a regular basis, even if they were educational, and my envy was brief. <br>
  The guard caught me eyeing up the pages and placed it on his lap. He waved me on as the gate <br>
  cracked to let me out.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="9" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Leaving Temple, I was soon on a wide and flat lane gravitating toward the forest. I reached the <br>
  Wall and stared at it. Each time I came here I asked myself the same question; was defying Sect <br>
  Doctrine and stepping past this point worth it? The excited thump of my heart told me the answer. I <br>
  glanced behind to scan the roadside and check I was not in sight. Confident I was alone; I slid <br>
  through the sliver of space between the charged wires then held my breath for a beat. There was <br>
  nothing but silence. I had no idea how I'd done it, but one morning I was tired of plodding the <br>
  same ground, and I'd looked out into the forest with its thick tree trunks, jutting roots, and <br>
  seen a thrilling new route to push myself harder and faster. I had stood, and stared at the webbing <br>
  of steel then wished for a hole to climb through. The wires had just unraveled without setting off <br>
  the klaxon. I remembered thinking with a horrible kind of panic that I had somehow done <br>
  witchcraft, and was convinced I was the blackest kind of evil. Then I realized how ridiculous I <br>
  was being, and figured it was a coincidental gift from the universe, or something. Now every <br>
  morning I had a new obstacle course to enjoy.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="10" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The trees were tall, and the air was fresh and clean and free. I ran, racing the beat of my own <br>
  footballs. Cold wind whipped past pushing hair into my face. Gods, how I loved to run and revel in <br>
  the illusion of freedom it gave. I was the fastest Disciple at the Temple, and the best at <br>
  cross-country; it took a lot to tire me out. I ran until the forest became too dense for me to <br>
  sprint without tripping over roots. My chest rising and falling was a pleasant feeling I rarely got <br>
  to experience, and only could experience when I ran Outside. Pushing at the long and dark tangle of <br>
  my hair, I wished there was less of it. I snapped off a knobby twig from a shrub at my heel and <br>
  pulled it back into a messy bun, using the twig to pin it there. I was distracted, and only because <br>
  a raven boldly cutting past drew my attention from the task of managing my hair, did I see a <br>
  movement at the corner of my eye.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="11" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="12" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A figure strode away from me up a leafy incline, into the light side of the daybreak.<br>
  “Hai?” I called my voice low.<br>
  The retreating shape paused, only to dart deeper into the gloom. Cresting the slope it winked out <br>
  of sight. I ran after it. It seemed like the thing to do at the time. Skidding to a stop at the <br>
  slope summit, I let out a surprised grunt. I could see down and far out into the forest. There was <br>
  nobody down there, nothing but more trees. Fear whispered in my ear no humans are supposed to be <br>
  Outside, but I shook it off. Such a thing was surely nothing but my imagination. No demon would be <br>
  this close to the Temple. It would be like a human who wanted to live a long life doing a jig with <br>
  their eyes closed on the edge of a cliff.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="13" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Then I saw it again. The shadowed figure was there when I turned around, but was at the bottom of <br>
  the slope. My feet skipped back then there was no more floor.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="14" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I remembered the same time my head moved to where my feet had been, that I'd been standing on the <br>
  apex of a steep and high slope. I went down. I tumbled backward and ended up rolling and rolling. <br>
  The world churned around me, but leveled out abruptly as I crashed into the base of a tree at the <br>
  slopes underside.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="15" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My arse was up in the air and my shins mashed against my forehead. Oh gods it hurt. I rocked my <br>
  body until I fell onto my side, and pulled my legs back to curl them under me. I breathed in and <br>
  out slowly, mentally checking myself over.<br>
  Nothing felt broken. I sat up and stretched it out. No, nothing was broken. The pendant I wore <br>
  around my neck pressed into my collarbone awkwardly. I fiddled with it until it hung properly, and <br>
  the leather cord was no longer choking me.<br>
  I stood and rubbed at my head, then tried to get my bearings.<br>
  The slope was too steep to climb back up and I wasn't much into rock climbing. Like most people I <br>
  was reasonably tolerable of heights, up to a certain point and tolerable with deep water, up to a <br>
  certain point. And even agreeable with confined spaces. Up to a certain point. Heights especially <br>
  high were a stickler with me, despite my love of the things you could do when you were especially <br>
  high. I had a way of pretending the floor was much closer than it truly was.<br>
  Nevertheless, the slope was too high to pretend, so I was either going left or right. Determined to <br>
  stay calm, I ignored the first curls of fear in my stomach. I</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="16" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="17" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">hadn't explored this far out into the forest yet and based on how long I had run for, I was at <br>
  least ten miles from the Wall. I was not worried about the time; I could still get back for <br>
  breakfast and with enough time to walk to class with Alex. Looking to the east the sky was <br>
  lightening to blue, but the sunrise was always painfully slow. Classes did not start until the sun <br>
  was in the sky.<br>
  I picked the straightest line through the trees as I could, and started off, my boots slapping <br>
  muddy puddles riddling the way. In the early morning the forest was empty of human presence apart <br>
  from its familiar visitor in me, but it was creepy now, like someone was watching.<br>
  A short while later it was clear I'd done something wrong. The trees were getting denser, and more <br>
  closely packed together, like I was going further into the forest. I stopped and spun around. My <br>
  first instinct was to go back. I was walking in a straight line, and I could go back to the slope <br>
  base and start again. I had been walking in a straight line, hadn't I? Those nasty curls of fear <br>
  tickled my insides again. I started to walk back, but stopped after less than half a mile. I <br>
  scanned the ground. Horrified at what I did not see, I knelt down to get a better look. To my <br>
  dismay I could not see any footprints or other evidence I had passed this way. All Clerics were <br>
  master trackers, bested only by shifters who changed into predators like big cats. As a Disciple I <br>
  had been trained in the basics of tracking, of course, and at that moment I felt the bitter sting <br>
  of failure. What I should have done the moment I felt lost is literally retraced my steps and <br>
  started again. But I hadn't done that. I'd let the fear get one up on me, and plunged into the <br>
  forest without thinking. I needed to calm down and focus. I figured if I went high, I could see <br>
  further around me.<br>
  I strode back a pace, and took a running jump at a broad oak trunk. I reached the lowest branch <br>
  starting five feet or so above my head, and dug my fingertips into the bark. Tree climbing was <br>
  easy, and in no time I hauled my body over the highest bough that would hold my weight. I balanced <br>
  on my toes, hands to knees. Exhaling my breath was visible plumes of wispy vapor, and for a few <br>
  seconds I chugged circular globules to amuse myself.<br>
  It was cold, it being the end of autumn, but the cooler days didn't bother me. It was a welcome <br>
  change since my body had always run hot.<br>
  The clouds on the horizon were dark with rain, darker than the sky now. They rolled low and blocked <br>
  out the coming light. There was a thick hum in the air, a</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="18" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="19" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">sure sign a storm was blowing in. My heart did a jig in my chest, and my mood picked up, for I <br>
  simply loved a good storm. The clean scent of crushed needle leaf on the breeze was refreshing, and <br>
  a nice change to the ashy smell that saturated everything at the Temple.<br>
  Getting back on track, I looked around in a wide circle. I bit my lip and looked the circle again, <br>
  slower this time. I was in trouble. I couldn't see the Wall or the end of the forest. I must have <br>
  run much further than I usually did before I'd fallen. Then I'd walked even further in the wrong <br>
  direction.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="20" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I stood, clasped the branch overhead and skipped to the edge of my perch. Loosening my hold above, <br>
  I pushed back with my foot and both my arms stretched back. I arced into a crescent and was <br>
  momentarily suspended in the air. The crown of my head raced to catch my arms as my legs coiled and <br>
  flew overhead. The world was crazy for a second; up was down, down was up.<br>
  Pointed feet followed my legs around and then I was falling. Feet a foot apart, my knees bent to <br>
  absorb impact as I landed, arms extended either side of me for balance.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="21" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">That bit of fun helped chase away some of my distress. I was good at identifying my emotions and <br>
  could control them with distractions if I caught them early enough. There were several notable <br>
  times I'd allowed myself to fall into foul rages, where I'd thrown things about and punched walls, <br>
  laughing as I did so.<br>
  The most frequent were bouts of manic happiness where everything was funny. The worst and hardest <br>
  to control were the dark humors. Sometimes the twisted things my imagination threw at me were only <br>
  scary, and off-colour to think about once I'd snapped out of it. I'd always been odd, different to <br>
  the girls around me, and those times where I'd lost control made some people suspicious and afraid <br>
  of me.<br>
  Oh yes, I'd become good at controlling myself.<br>
  Back down below the forest canopy it was dark. The sunrays had not broken through the leaves, and <br>
  the understory had a monochromatic look. Silver bark, grey leaves and black spaces between. I <br>
  pushed some hair out of my eyes that had gotten loose from my makeshift bun, and breathed in. <br>
  Smells of the forest, nutty sycamore maples and sweet night flowers releasing the last of their <br>
  fragrance, were strangely comforting. I was deep into wild and civilization was far behind, but I <br>
  knew panicking would only make things worse.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="22" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="23" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A faint rustle ahead made me pause and swiftly reconsider panicking. Another, louder rustle made <br>
  me tense. A tingle of fear ran down the back of my legs. The forest was full of animals of course, <br>
  deer, badgers and more birds than I could name, though the most popular was the raven.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="24" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The thought I'd been consciously avoiding until now, making me want to lie where I was then die <br>
  quietly and run shrieking in the opposite direction, was that I was in demon territory.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="25" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A flicker of light illuminated the leaf edges in the darkness. I heard a low murmur of sound, <br>
  hushed and urgent. Instinctively crouching down, I crawled forward and was scared. Voices. Demons <br>
  spoke, of course. They were bloodthirsty and evil, but intelligent too. Like a rational individual, <br>
  I could have gone the other way, but then I would not know what kind of demon was close by. If they <br>
  were shifters with tracking skills, I was no better than a dead body anyway. Soon, I saw the pale <br>
  glare of artificial light and inched closer, keeping myself low to the floor. My knees scrapped <br>
  sharp twigs, hard stones. The prickly leaves of low grown shrubs stroked my cheeks, and forehead, <br>
  as I pushed forward. My breathing sounded too loud in my ears, and I tried to breathe shallow. I <br>
  kept my moves small and stealthy, like I was taught in Subterfuge when learning how to track demons <br>
  for the element of surprise.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="26" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Ahead of me, there was a small clearing and three bodies in it.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="27" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Two were human, Clerics, identified by the peculiar hooded crimson blazers they wore with black <br>
  tails that flowed to their knees. The wide, pointed hood could cover your face to the nose, and the <br>
  well-known white-eye sigil stitched on their breast pockets, commanded fear from demons and <br>
  submission from Disciples.<br>
  The one facing me was female with her hood down. She was skeletal with mud colored hair and pinched <br>
  lips, but would be attractive if you like women with up- tilted eyes and a mean-looking <br>
  disposition. The other had his back to me and<br>
  was a well-built male. Small but compact with big arms and calves.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="28" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">To my horror the feeling that surged through me was not relief. These Clerics would take me back to <br>
  the compound, and I would get into heaps of trouble having to somehow explain the hole in the <br>
  Wall. But that versus being caught by a demon and killed was preferable, right? No. I sat in my <br>
  hiding place and quaked in my boots. My stomach twisted into a double knot and my teeth chattered, <br>
  because something bad was happening.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="29" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="30" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The third body in the clearing was a demon. A kind I had never seen before in my life, meaning she <br>
  could only be one thing. Green skin damp and scarlet hair wild, the fairy was sprawled across the <br>
  forest floor in a tangle of her own gawky limbs. It was clear to me she was terrified. Her vibrant <br>
  skin looked sallow and her eyes blood shot. A tazer probe buzzed in her shoulder blade, another on <br>
  her upper thigh. She was crying, a pitiful high keen that was so frail I could barely hear it.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="31" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The Lady Cleric twisted the probe deeper into the fairy's leg. “Why do you spy on the Academy?” she <br>
  asked with chilling calm.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="32" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The fairy-girl cringed back. “I mean you no harm.” “And here I thought a fairy could tell no lie.”<br>
  “I can't.” The high chime of her voice shook on each word. “I speak the truth. Let me go, you don't <br>
  understand what will happen. My brothers-”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="33" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The Lord Cleric punched her. Her head flew back and a spray of blood wet the dry mud and spattered <br>
  over the leaves concealing me. Face wet with tears and whimpering, she tried to crawl toward the <br>
  trees and dragged up clumps of earth with her fingernails.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="34" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You must let me go.” The words sounded muffled, like she had a mouthful of something foul.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="35" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The Lord Cleric executed a neat half turn and stamped on her thigh. There was a sharp snap, like <br>
  I'd picked up a twig and yanked on the ends until the fibers split apart and cracked open. The <br>
  fairy's leg buckled into an unnatural shape and she screamed. The sound was guttural, a direct <br>
  translation of pain to sound. I slapped a hand over my mouth to smother my own shriek. Not because <br>
  of the broken bone, I'd seen and heard tons of those, but because I'd caught the Lord Clerics <br>
  profile and recognized the handsome face. The Lord Cleric dragged the fairy back into the centre of <br>
  the clearing and brought a knife to her face. Clamping a gloved hand over her mouth, he slashed the <br>
  blade across her cheek. Blood seeped from the wound and strangely, the smell of sizzling flesh <br>
  seeped into the air. I gagged.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="36" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It was then my body reacted. It was something natural hidden deep within, you see. I know it now, <br>
  but didn't know it then, so my actions made no sense to me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="37" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="38" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Lurching forward, I snapped twigs beneath me and reached out to her. The Lady Cleric spun and a <br>
  big, blocky thing appeared in her hands. A gun. I crouched and froze. She peered into the trees for <br>
  the source of the noise, and I stepped back, snapping another twig underfoot.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="39" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The fairy's red irises twitched to me. We locked gazes and recognition made her eyes blaze, her <br>
  face crease with panic.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="40" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">She whispered, “Run.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="41" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The Lady Cleric's gun swung, jerked, and a gunshot cracked the air. The fairy- girl convulsed then <br>
  was still, so still.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="42" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I was frozen, horrified. I'd seen demons bagged and tagged before when they had dared to breach the <br>
  Wall and threaten human society, but we were Outside. This was their territory. What could she, a <br>
  fairy-girl child, have possibly done to deserve torture and execution?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="43" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Show yourself,” commanded the Lady Cleric. She stepped forward this time and her eyes roamed the <br>
  space. She clutched the gun more securely between her hands. “Show yourself, I say. Come out so we <br>
  can look at you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="44" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">When a Cleric asked you a question you answered, and if they bade you to do something, you did it. <br>
  They upheld Sect Doctrine. The Sect was the single most powerful organization humankind invested <br>
  their faith and security in. If a Cleric told you to do something, the Sect was telling you to do <br>
  something. And you did it without question, without thinking. They commanded and you obeyed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="45" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I knew if I did as she asked, I was as dead as the fairy-girl on the floor not ten feet from me. <br>
  Her word echoed in my ear. Run. It was the only plan I had. I stood from my hiding place, wheeled <br>
  on the spot, and bolted into the darkness.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="46" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The sound of another bullet split the air. Something whipped past my arm and left a hot sting. Feet <br>
  stumbling, the tears streamed down my face. Thorny branches tore at my clothes and hair. I crashed <br>
  through the undergrowth, not caring how loud I was or that they would be able to track me I needed <br>
  to get away. Run, run and hide. I had witnessed something hidden, and knew if they caught me, they <br>
  would kill me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="47" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A dark shape jumped into my path and brought the butt of a gun hurtling toward</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="48" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="49" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">my face. One forearm came up to protect my head and jerked violently. Then I cranked back my fist <br>
  and snapped it forward. The answering grunt told me it was the Lady Cleric. As she staggered the <br>
  gun swung again, barrel first and forced me to drop and roll. Using the force of my body popping <br>
  up, I spun, cocked my leg and kicked like mule. My heel connected with her upper back and sent her <br>
  off-kilter-stance to hell. She flew toward a tree, spindly arms and legs flailing to hit an oak <br>
  trunk hard. She collapsed to the floor in a messed up heap.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="50" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I'd struck a Cleric. Something crazy people with death wishes did. It was dark and I fretted she <br>
  saw my face and would recognize me in a crowd. People had always said my hazel eyes were an <br>
  outlandish shade hard to disregard and off- putting.<br>
  Loud footfalls pounded behind me, getting closer. I ran again.<br>
  Short violent barks turned my blood to ice. Hounds, they had bloodhounds. I forced strength into <br>
  moving my feet one in front of the other. Hands fisted, my arms alternated pumping back and forth. <br>
  The air was solid resistance I needed to punch out of the way as much as the tree branches riddling <br>
  my path. But I was tired. For the first time I felt my abnormal strength and stamina waning. There <br>
  was a growl behind me, too close, and a snap of jaws at my heel.<br>
  My mind emptied and my heart skipped a thump as unexpected energy trilled through my body like an <br>
  electric shock. The dark deepened into new dimensions. Shades of electric blue and purple tinted my <br>
  vision, and I could see everything.<br>
  Power exploded from my centre, filling my body to the brim. A sound like guck choked out of my <br>
  throat in ecstasy, I felt so animated. I shot forward like a comet and the forest blurred into <br>
  flowing lines I distinguished as if standing still. Air glided out my way as I hurtled forward, and <br>
  my feet glanced effortlessly off the floor, not leaving the slightest imprint in the earth beneath <br>
  me.<br>
  Taken by shock, I planted my feet and slammed to still.<br>
  The landscape shifted dramatically, and my sense of direction was completely disoriented. I <br>
  trembled at the thrumming of air crashing into the collapsing void I'd created behind. Then my eyes <br>
  started to hurt, opened too wide. The lash of pain on my arm flared painfully then dulled into <br>
  nothing. I wiped at it. Again and again, crying out and scrubbing at my arm in panic looking for <br>
  the graze.<br>
  There was nothing but clammy skin and a dried smear of blood where a cut</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="51" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="52" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">should be.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="53" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It was then the fear took hold of me and I lost control. My chest heaved and I choked a sob. The <br>
  crazy sound smashing my ears had me seeing double, and my own breath razed across my eardrums. <br>
  Racked with shivers, I curled into a ball at the base of a tree. My body spasmed once then the <br>
  convulsions were frequent and uncontrollable. I kept my teeth clenched to avoid biting my tongue <br>
  and tucked my arms into my sides. The position, though safe was not comforting. I buried my face in <br>
  the leaves and scrunched my legs into my chest. I cried out at each lash of pain. My muscles kept <br>
  up this hedonistic clench and release until they cramped into bunches. Waves of heat shot down my <br>
  spine, and splinters of ice burrowed into the space between my pores. Each assault was more painful <br>
  than the last. I shivered as the wind fluttered my sweat soaked my clothes. What hurt most was my <br>
  head, the pumping of blood in my ears, ringing between my eyes, and the overwhelming scent of my <br>
  own fear clogging my nose.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="54" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Gradually the pain subsided and breathing became easier. My heart took it down a notch and I was <br>
  grateful, for I was not sure it could take much more.<br>
  Quivering, my muscles relaxed and stayed relaxed. With a great measure of wonder, I realized there <br>
  was no longer pain, but an overwhelming sense of all things. Despite my emotional exhaustion my <br>
  body felt better, and I felt different. Strong.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="55" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Have you calmed down now?” asked an amused voice above me. “I have been told an awakening is <br>
  easier if you are calm.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="56" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I sprung up to defend myself. My hands were fisted and my face fierce.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="57" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">At first sight all I made out was a male shape, an impression of someone tall and built. In the <br>
  lightening dark all I could see were his eyes, wide and cold eyes touched with mad, framed by a <br>
  tangle of thick lashes. His grey irises were so light they could be silver. They burned, scorched <br>
  me as his gaze flicked over my face and body. He wore dark, faded jeans and that was that. Feet and <br>
  chest bare, he was the least civilized boy I'd seen. His skin, pale and covered with intricate <br>
  tattoos, scintillated even in the absence of light. During my steady appraisal my hands had dropped <br>
  and relaxed, but they clenched again. Boys slid their eyes up and down you before whistling to <br>
  catch your attention. They did not stare at you until your insides felt like outsides. The <br>
  directness of his gaze had me mystified, and I was already under the influence of so many emotions <br>
  the only way I could</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="58" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="59" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">react to something I could not understand, was with violence.<br>
  However, he remained close and did not look alarmed at my aggressive posture. Belittling the tense <br>
  atmosphere, his face lit up with a smile.<br>
  “Rae,” he murmured and stepped closer.<br>
  He lifted his arms as if to embrace me. One more step would close the distance between us <br>
  completely.<br>
  I was scared, so scared. I couldn't speak. There were no words or coherent thoughts in my head. It <br>
  was a jumble of panic and cautious interest. Who was he? Was he another Cleric? Would he kill me <br>
  now? Oh gods. I would become one of the faceless and nameless that went missing every year. To be <br>
  forgotten as my body rotted or was left to become a demon dinner. I couldn't handle it, nor could <br>
  my body functions manage the full-scale meltdown. My legs buckled and the world went a funny gray <br>
  colour. I fainted, but told myself I didn't have time to faint, and came to in the next second. <br>
  Not that my actions meant anything, or my revival is what stopped my ass hitting the ground. The <br>
  boy darted forward so fast his body blurred, and something hard and invisible shunted into me. So <br>
  hard it knocked the breath from my lungs. Pushed off centre, my legs flew up and the sky swung into <br>
  view.<br>
  He'd caught me.<br>
  “Stop talking,” he said. Then smiled.<br>
  I stared up at him dumbly. Was he making a joke? I hadn't said a word. In fact I think I'd <br>
  forgotten to breathe since I saw him, and that's what caused my half fainting spell.<br>
  I shifted. My top rode up some and his fingers touched my back. Something hot and powerful invaded <br>
  me. It charged through my body until every muscle was tense and straining, not pleasant after the <br>
  baptism of ice and fire I'd been an intimate and unwilling subject of before. And then it was gone, <br>
  dissipating into nothing. I relaxed so completely it felt like my bones had unhinged, and my <br>
  muscles liquefied.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="60" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The boy's face was blank with shock. Had he felt the painful heat too? I hoped so, because I was <br>
  sure it was his fault.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="61" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="62" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">There was a fracas nearby, getting closer and louder. My heart did a good job of clambering into my <br>
  throat and blocking my airway. The party hunting me crashed past and kept on going. The boy, who <br>
  had crouched down with me on his knee whilst I had worked on breathing right, ducked his head down <br>
  and tensed. I felt better because he too was barely breathing. My heart thundered and my thoughts <br>
  raced. The bloodhounds were trained to follow the weakest of trails. Why didn't they smell me when <br>
  my scent would have led them right to us? This brought me round to the daunting thought of how I <br>
  got so far ahead, was able to roll around on the floor, and encounter a strange boy before they had <br>
  caught up. Again, who was this boy, over whose arm and knee, I was draped? Not that it was <br>
  uncomfortable, but he'd put his hands on me so easily, and held me close and it feltgood. The shock <br>
  had me relaxing and looking down at his hands. They were big, hard and somehow elegant as they <br>
  curled around me.<br>
  The hunting party passed out of sight and hearing range. My stomach unclenched, and my heart slid <br>
  back down to rest uneasily in my chest. The boy remained as he was and peered into my face. My <br>
  heart raced at how tall and how strong he was. Hair cut close to his head the general impression <br>
  was hardness. A heavy top brow, and sharp cheekbones rested high on a sculpted face. His nose was <br>
  the opposite of the distinctive aquiline bridge most boy Disciples had, and I liked it. His bold <br>
  eyebrows and masculine lips added depth to a face that needed no flattering. The scent of soil and <br>
  sunlight reached me as I watched his silver eyes flick from my face, to the leather cord at my <br>
  neck.<br>
  “We've been looking for you,” he said.<br>
  The first words I'd spoken all day were, “Nobody looks for me, and how do you know my name?” Taken <br>
  aback by the feeble quality of my own voice, I lifted my chin and added some gusto. “I mean, put me <br>
  down. Now.”<br>
  He did no such thing and he did not answer my question. But he did smile again, and what a <br>
  spectacular show it was. His body was heavy and hot. Through the fabric of my clothes I felt the <br>
  hard lines of him, and the slow thump of his heart over mine. Without thinking, I reached to touch <br>
  his jaw and it felt like strength. My fingertips glided over a raised slash of skin, and a quick <br>
  tug tilted his head so I could see more of his profile. I traced a scar following the line of his <br>
  jaw, curving up to his cheekbone. The skin was puckered, rough. His eyes met mine and I shrugged, <br>
  the scar made him real to me. I snaked my hands up his bare, solid shoulders and jumped off him so <br>
  I stood on my own two feet.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="63" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="64" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I knew without a shadow of doubt this boy would rather die than hurt me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="65" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Rae,” he said softly. I shivered from silky soft calling of my name, but then he finished with, <br>
  “My name is Breandan, and you are mine.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="66" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My whole body jolted. Then my startled laugh broke the short silence. Needing space to think and <br>
  breathe, I pushed away from him.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="67" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“In your dreams,” I said and spun around.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="68" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I tried to pin down a direction to run toward. I realized at that moment my solution was downright <br>
  silly and ineffective. See bad, scary or confusing thing, turn and run from bad, scary or confusing <br>
  thing until you bump into another bad, scary or confusing thing. I was getting nowhere fast.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="69" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You wouldn't say such a thing if you knew the truth. And since I saw you first you have to be <br>
  mine. The white witch was right, and now I'll never hear the end of it. I didn't think you would <br>
  come out here so soon and so freely. I tried to ignore you, even when you got lost, but when I <br>
  heard you running away from them I had to help. They would have caught you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="70" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I'd stopped moving in the middle of this rationalization. His voice was awfully attractive. I could <br>
  never describe how it sounded because it would only ever sound perfect to me, and no one else. Once <br>
  I'd gotten past hearing the words I thought over the meaning. In delayed reaction my chest puffed <br>
  out and I bristled.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="71" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“The hell I do. People don't belong to one another, and I certainly do not belong to you, even if <br>
  you did see me firstwhatever that means. What stupid-”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="72" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He moved closer then I could see nothing but his eyes again. Mouth suddenly dry, I was unable to <br>
  finish my scathing rebuttal, and it took a moment to un-stick my tongue from the roof of my mouth. <br>
  A warm rolling sensation formed in the pit of my stomach and lodged there. It was an odd sensation, <br>
  it even hurt a little, but it was a nice pain. I breathed in deeply through my nose and expelled <br>
  the breath through my mouth. The whole deep breathing thing was helping.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="73" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Okay then, Breandan,” I said serenely but my heart thumped too hard and he coked his head as if he <br>
  could hear it. I went on nonetheless, “What do you want? Why are you in the forest, alone?” The <br>
  best defense is a good offence, and I could give as good as I got. “This is demon territory y'know. <br>
  I can admit I was</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="74" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="75" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">freaked and a bit off course.” He snorted a laugh and my temper bloated into righteous <br>
  indignation. “It's dark out here. I was running away from the Clerics because they had dogs.” My <br>
  eyes darted to and from his now, uncomfortable with the lie. “And Idon't like dogs. They bark. <br>
  Loudly. And how do you know my name?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="76" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">There was a beat of silence as his eyes held mine. “You will have to get out of the habit of lying. <br>
  You won't be able to do that for much longer. And anyway, you don't have to explain anything to me. <br>
  I understand. I know you, and that is why we have come for you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="77" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Are you from the slums?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="78" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">For a bad moment there I had assumed he was from the Sect. I would be in a world trouble if anyone <br>
  saw me out here. I was beyond the Wall, which was forbidden, and I had seen I didn't want to think <br>
  about the horror I'd seen, and how I'd been foolish enough to get caught seeing the thing I saw. I <br>
  had disobeyed a direct order from a Cleric, something I, a Disciple training to be a Cleric, should <br>
  never do. No, I was not so sure anymore. If Breandan was from the Sect he'd have called to the <br>
  Clerics, not hidden me from them. If he was a civilian, I didn't see how he could come to be lost <br>
  Outside. After all, you would have to get past the Wall to make it out here. There was not a human <br>
  alive that didn't understand the dangers of going over the Wall and into demon territory.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="79" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I felt stupid then. If there was not a human alive who didn't know how dangerous it was Outside, <br>
  what the hell was I doing Outside? I was going to have very serious words with myself.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="80" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Coming for you is not something I chose, and believe me, if I could change it I would.” He paused <br>
  and shook his head. “We are stuck. You belong to me,” he repeated. “And I to you. Now we have <br>
  touched it is sealed. Alright?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="81" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Sealed my ass. I decided then and there, I did not like this boy.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="82" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You cannot appear next to me in the middle of demon territory and say such silly things,” I said, <br>
  strained. “You're beginning to scare me.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="83" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">That was another lie. I was beyond sacred now. My body couldn't keep up a constant pitch of terror, <br>
  so it had simply gone beyond terror and pressed a big reset button. I was too afraid outside to be <br>
  anything but calm inside. Voice</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="84" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="85" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">unattractively shrill, I lowered my clenched fist and took a deep breath. I moderated my voice.<br>
  “Let's start with where you're from?”<br>
  He sighed and scrubbed a hand over his head. “A place not too far from here. You are very lost.”<br>
  I shifted on the spot. “Are you transferring to this region to be a Disciple?” It happened. Rarely, <br>
  for it was too hazardous to travel large distances through demon territory, and it was only <br>
  attempted once a settlement had reached a population density that put all the humans there in <br>
  danger. But it did happen. He shook his head. “Are you visiting Cleric at the Temple?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="86" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I was reaching, but that could explain how he could be so comfortable in the forest. Clerics were <br>
  not like regular people and often came from hardy families. The Clerics were the fastest, strongest <br>
  most intelligent and intuitive of humankind. That is why they managed to keep us so safe.<br>
  His face darkened. “No.” The word was fired at me like a bullet.<br>
  Without preparing myself for the answer I asked with catty aplomb, “Are you a demon then?”<br>
  “Oh yes,” he said softly.</p>

  <h2 id="chp2" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Chapter Two</h2>
  <p class = "para1" id="88" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  I waited for the fear and for the panic. I waited for the scream of terror to rip from my throat, <br>
  but it never came. I waited for him to grab me, and murder me, and cut me into pieces and hide me <br>
  under the small patch of wild flowers over there. But he said and did nothing. The clever thing <br>
  would have been to get the hell out of there and start running again. But I didn't want to, and I <br>
  was curious as to who and what he was. I wanted to know why he was stood in front of me, and what <br>
  he was after.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="89" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His gaze raked over me again and again, looking for something.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="90" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“If you didn't think you were safe you would ask me to leave,” he said. “And, if you wanted me to <br>
  leave, I would have done so already.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="91" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I hated that his words made sense to me. “Stop trying to be clever, demon-boy.” “I'm trying to help <br>
  you, demon-girl.”<br>
  His words had the same impact as a blow to the head. I twitched liked he'd pinched me all over and <br>
  staggered back.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="92" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I knew then something menacing was coming around the corner. I had to accept what he had told me <br>
  next, right? Not to acknowledge the undeniable truth would be foolish. A tear slid down my face and <br>
  landed with a soft plunk on my front. I had always been different, strange, but within the realms <br>
  of human strange.<br>
  Undoubtedly, I knew I'd gone beyond the boundaries.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="93" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He stepped closer, closer still, and our clothes rustled as they touched. Lowering his forehead to <br>
  touch mine, warm fingers found my hands and coaxed them to entwine with his. I did not like the way <br>
  my body was reacting to him. It overruled logic and it was beginning to upset me. Something was <br>
  happening to me and I didn't understand what. Worse, I couldn't explain to myself why I was still <br>
  there talking to him.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="94" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His finger tapped my chin up. “I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said it like that, but I was never good <br>
  with words.” His voice was serious and complicated. His hand clasping my chin released the knot <br>
  that had formed in my stomach, and with a</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="95" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="96" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">sob, I dragged in a breath to control my tears. “Don't do it,” he warned and used his hold on my <br>
  chin to tug my face closer. “To cry over learning the truth is useless. It should empower you.” He <br>
  stroked my cheek, wiping the tear there. “You're sad,” he said brusquely and watched me fight to <br>
  control myself, “That tells me I have not done this right. Maybe now is not the time to have this <br>
  talk. I have responsibilities I cannot ignore simply because it will hurt not to be around you. <br>
  I'll explain better when I return.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="97" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">With no other option I nodded slowly. And then I knocked his hands off me. Whatever was so <br>
  important he needed to leave me well, that was fine. “You don't have to justify anything to me,” I <br>
  said. “I don't know you and I don't expect to ever see you again.” He didn't owe me a thing and I <br>
  was happy he was leaving.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="98" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I could get back to being lost, and worried about being lost.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="99" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“So stubborn. I can admit not to see you will be hard. Can you not look outside yourself for a <br>
  moment to do the same?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="100" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The intention was to tear into him about his stupid, confusing statements that made no sense, but <br>
  as my head turned his lips brushed along my chin. Gravity shifted and flowed into his eyes to <br>
  ground me. The world darkened to nothing as they drew me deeper into their shaded depths. My lips <br>
  parted in a sigh, and my hands swept around his waist as he pulled me closer. His hand tangled into <br>
  my hair as my own moved over his lower back. I breathed in the heady smell of sunlight from his <br>
  chest, and the scent became a taste on my tongue. Exploring the dip in his spine, I glided the pads <br>
  of my fingers into the shallow grove flowing uninterrupted to his shoulder blades. My hands left <br>
  his back then I hesitated in my exploration. The sensation that slicked over my palms was, odd. <br>
  Hovering a few inches away from his skin the air felt warmer, thicker.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="101" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He jerked back and spun away to look into the forest. He peered around us, and the waves of <br>
  hostility pulsing from his body cranked the tension in the air up. He stood, all wound up and <br>
  tense, so I got all wound up and tense, and we fed of each other until I was panting. It was <br>
  uncomfortably wearing for someone like me who was already beyond terrified.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="102" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan said, “Rae, go back to the Temple now. That direction.” He pointed into the trees. When I <br>
  didn't move he twisted me around by the shoulder, and</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="103" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="104" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">pushed me in the direction he'd pointed.<br>
  I kind of stumbled a few steps forward before I stopped, and realized I didn't have to do what he <br>
  said. “But, you can't tell me I'm a demon then stop explaining.”<br>
  I wanted to stay, badly, but sense was telling me I had to leave like he said.<br>
  “You don't have to argue with every word I say. We'll come for you later. Go now.”<br>
  Returning his steady gaze with one of my own, I picked up on something I'd been unconsciously <br>
  registering. There was a barrier between Breandan and I. Pulling my brows together, I tilted my <br>
  head to watch him, watch me. Not a physical or tangible barrier; invisible. He shimmered and <br>
  rippled into something different. A soft nimbus coated his entire being. Pearlescent it repelled my <br>
  gaze.<br>
  “Stop hiding from me and I'll go,” I said. “You want me to trust you and I can manage some trust <br>
  since you haven't killed me. But you have to trust me back. You say you're a demon, well then what <br>
  kind? Show me your true form.”<br>
  “I don't have the time for this.”<br>
  “Come on, it can't take that long. Show me then you can run off and do whatever you were doing <br>
  before you just had to help me.”<br>
  He made a noise of frustration and pointed again. “Will you at least move in the right direction as <br>
  we talk?”<br>
  I nodded curtly. I was persistent not stupid. If he was this antsy something bad must be coming <br>
  this way.<br>
  “If we run I can get you back and maybe catch it up. Follow me,” he said.<br>
  And then he was gone. One moment he's walking, and the next he's a silver blur zipping through the <br>
  trees ahead of me.<br>
  It was odd, because I knew it was demon fast, but I could track his movement with my gaze. Was it <br>
  crazy that I wanted to follow him? Grudgingly, I admitted to myself I'd never wanted to follow <br>
  someone so badly, and I was never one to</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="105" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="106" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">shy away from a physical challenge. I'd run blindingly fast from the hounds, and the only <br>
  difference between now and then was that I was scared. Huh, piece of cake. I had loads of scared <br>
  stored up around the solar plexus area. Tapping into the well of energy inside me was too easy, and <br>
  I burst forward.<br>
  Everything was so bright and lively, and it was nothing for me to flow across the land at a <br>
  velocity strange, yet comforting. Breandan took a sharp turn and I was pleased to see I was <br>
  gaining, gliding across the ground at his side. A chuckle caught my ear. I had made him laugh, and <br>
  a silly tide of happiness blazed through me. I grinned, and laughed, and sped up to leave him <br>
  trailing behind.<br>
  The floor yielded to every pound of my foot. Not a single branch snagged my hair or cut my skin <br>
  because I didn't let it. I zipped and dodged, jumped and spun a trail in the undergrowth. I didn't <br>
  know where I was running to, but it felt good to be in motion.<br>
  The air was heavy with a piquant scent that fizzed on my tongue. The silhouette of trees taller <br>
  than any I'd seen rose high in the sky, and a few stars already winked down at me. I'm not a <br>
  botanist, so all I can say is that there were plants. A big orgy of red, blues and purples <br>
  scattered everywhere. The breeze was crisp and made everything sway in orderly chaos. The buzzing <br>
  of insect and restless whining of beast punctured the dawn in harmonic beat.<br>
  I knew the moment Breandan's hand reached for mine. My skin tingled and like a magnet seeking its <br>
  opposite, my hand moved to meet his. A light tug slowed me to a stop. I plucked a leaf from my hair <br>
  and brushed a lick of dirt off my cheek. I could have continued this grooming session for a while <br>
  since I felt twigs and thorns caught in my clothes and hair, but I was distracted.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="107" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan stood still and let me roam my eyes over him. His profile was sharper somehow, and I <br>
  pushed the hair out of my eyes to drink the strong column of throat that flowed into solid chest. <br>
  His ears held my attention for a long while, couldn't say why, before my gaze slid over the <br>
  straightness of his nose, and the strong planes of his cheek and forehead.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="108" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Let's keep moving,” he said. I stood still and he had to either tug me again or let go of my hand. <br>
  He let go and sighed dramatically. “Stop being difficult. If you're not back at Temple soon, <br>
  they'll be suspicious of you and it won't be safe there anymore.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="109" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="110" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He walked off and took no more than five steps before I felt an insistent tug, a niggling urge <br>
  pushing me toward him. I suspected it had something to do with that painful heat I'd felt when he'd <br>
  touched me skin to skin for the first time. He had a lot of explaining to do. Gritting my teeth, I <br>
  started after him and reached out the same moment as he did to clasp hands. We trod a path of <br>
  crunching leaves and snapping twigs. The breeze was sweetly fragrant and smelled of green things. <br>
  It was quiet now apart from the sound of small furry things going about their business in the <br>
  understory.<br>
  “Speak then,” I said. “Don't go all shy on me.” “I'm a fairy.”<br>
  I blinked and froze. The wind stirred fallen leaves and wrapped his words around me. A few words <br>
  truly can take your breath away, or make you doubt your own mind. I walked on, not seeing, hearing <br>
  or feeling.<br>
  I managed a sharp noise. “You must think I'm stupid or something. You want me to believe that you <br>
  are one of the rarest species on the planet?”<br>
  He bit back a smile. “You believed I was a demon easily enough.”<br>
  “Well, we are in demon territory. You hid from Clerics and only demons do that.”<br>
  “You ran from Clerics.”<br>
  He had me there. “Uh, we're not talking about me,” I said hotly. “I'm not the smartest girl, but <br>
  I'm not stupid either. I'll be just as impressed if you tell me you're a shifter or witch.”<br>
  “What about me don't you believe?” he asked after a small pause.<br>
  I was on a sarcasm-high now. “Yeah, sure. I believe you. Lucky Rae see's two fairies, the one kind <br>
  of demon that is nearly extinct. And she sees them within minutes of each other. Even though the <br>
  odds of that are-”<br>
  “What did the other look like?”<br>
  “Uh, green skin and all this long fiery hair.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="111" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="112" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He made a clucking noise meant to sound cross, but he smiled radiantly, silver eyes faraway. “I <br>
  told her to hide her true form.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="113" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The direction of my thoughts became hideously plain, and icy horror froze the blood in my veins.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="114" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I'm guessing you know her?” I tried to keep the question casual but my voice sounded shrill.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="115" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“The fairy you saw is called Maeve. She's my little sister.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="116" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I stared at him, my lips becoming numb. “Sister,” I whispered. “How can you know that? Aren't all <br>
  of your females green with red hair?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="117" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Do all human females have light hair, eyes and skin? No, all fairies are unique, though, there are <br>
  typical things like our pointed ears and sharp teeth.” He must have figured I was having a simple <br>
  moment. I didn't back chat like I usually would. “Don't worry,” his voice was gentle. “Maeve is a <br>
  force of good. She's been looking for you too, and she wouldn't hurt you. She's young and stealth <br>
  is not her gift. She has skills with a blade not even Conall can match.” There was a deep affection <br>
  in his voice as he spoke of her.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="118" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I felt dirty for not saying something sooner and opened my mouth to speak. Those curls of fear <br>
  sprung up in my belly, and lashed at my insides to silence me. I locked my jaw. No words seemed <br>
  adequate enough to explain what had happened. Before I had been sad about what had happened to the <br>
  fairy, even guilty. Who knows what would have happened if I hadn't spooked the Clerics. They might <br>
  have let her go. If I told him what happened, how I'd disturbed them and gotten his sister killed, <br>
  what would he do to me?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="119" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Oh gods, I felt queasy. The stress was eating away at me, and I was wound up tight right down to my <br>
  baby toes.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="120" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Then the outline of something big prowled past, ghosting through the trees. I forgot about <br>
  Breandan, I forgot I'd seen his sister take a bullet to the chest, and forgot I was lost in demon <br>
  territory as my entire body locked down. Blood rushed in my ears as the shadow trod a path parallel <br>
  to where we stood.<br>
  Breandan was calm and unmoved so I toughed it out, and stayed put.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="121" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It emerged from behind a tree a few paces away to cross our path. Black and</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="122" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="123" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">freckled with flaxen rosettes, the big cat's emerald eyes with slitted black pupils, swept over us. <br>
  The powerful build and handsome face were too brawny to be anything but male. Slinking to a stop, <br>
  his ears pricked up and he looked me right in the eye. A wave of consciousness flashed across my <br>
  skin, and for a beat I couldn't breathe.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="124" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He padded over, thick claws glinting and pressed into my legs. A soft growl rumbled in his throat <br>
  and his whole body vibrated. I tensed then flexed my hand and let it drift down. As he pushed his <br>
  wet nose into my palm the growl became a satisfied purr. The cat was warm and smelt musky. My <br>
  fingers rubbed up the coarse hair behind his ears then smoothed it down. He nipped at my finger and <br>
  I yelped. He twitched at the sound, and the long whiskers on his upper lip whistled as they cut <br>
  through the air. Nudging the back of my knee he made a contented noise, tinged with almost an <br>
  apology for startling me. His eyes lingered on mine, blinked at me then he sniffed the air and <br>
  gathered his front and back paws together. Ears flat against his head, he paced forward and slinked <br>
  lower.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="125" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I gasped, spotting a sable colored deer grazing within my line of sight, half hidden by a few <br>
  dogwood trees. The cat's muscles bunched tightly before he sprung forward and bounded away. I <br>
  didn't watch what happened to the deer after that.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="126" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan watched me, head cocked thoughtfully.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="127" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I marveled at the short ebony hairs stuck on my fingertips. Evidence my encounter had been real. I <br>
  trembled.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="128" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Did that mean something to you?” I asked quietly.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="129" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Oh yes,” he replied and took hold of my hand, and started to walk again. “Nothing out here will <br>
  harm you unless you pick a fight first.” He paused. “Usually shifters are not that sociable. Rarely <br>
  do they interact with those outside their pack, even when they leave Pride territory. Do not make a <br>
  habit of petting them. Despite your difficult personality, I will protect you until death, but <br>
  would prefer not to have to deal with such dire circumstances unless necessary.” Jerking to a stop <br>
  he yanked gently on the ends of my hair to pull my head back. “Alright?” His teeth nipped my neck <br>
  then his lips pressed a kiss to my pulse point. There he stood amongst the trees, smiling down on <br>
  me and waiting for my answer.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="130" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="131" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">All the while, for all that I'd just experienced and all he'd told me, all I could think was, he <br>
  kissed my neck.<br>
  “Believe it or not I don't skip around looking for trouble. I only come out here for some space to <br>
  think and run. And I can take care of myself.”<br>
  After a beat of silence he chuckled and walked on, continuing to tow me along side.<br>
  A shifter. I had stroked a were-cat, one of the most feral demons in existence. Only Breandan's <br>
  firm grip and steady steps forward kept me moving.<br>
  “I never realized the different demon kinds lived so close together,” I said. “Our territories are <br>
  vast. Right now we are in his back garden. The Pride<br>
  encompasses the entire human prison. That is why we showed respect and stayed still. If he had <br>
  taken issue with us here, he would have let me know. But then he has probably scented the vampire <br>
  too, and is happy to have the extra help in hunting it down.”<br>
  “Prison,” I echoed, startled. “Vampire?”<br>
  Saying the name made my toes scrunch together in my boots and my stomach pitch dangerously. The <br>
  dead ones were not demons people dressed up to make scarier than they actually were. Vampires were <br>
  the creatures you made nicer in stories so that you didn't pass out when reports one had breached <br>
  the Wall, and eaten a few homeless people came your way.<br>
  “Is that not what it is? A prison the humans have locked themselves inside?” There was too much <br>
  behind that simple statement I could not begin to get into.<br>
  “So, you can go wherever you like? To hunt vampires, I mean. It doesn't matter you're not his <br>
  kind?” I was fascinated. I had learned more about demonkind in one hour than years of training.<br>
  “Why would I not be able to go where I liked? There has not been a war between demonkind and we <br>
  respect each other enough not impose foolish rules of ownership. Though most of us do avoid <br>
  venturing into vampire cities. Shifters are bestial under a full moon, but sensible for the most <br>
  part. The alpha-male</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="132" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="133" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">keeps them in good order. As for the vampire, he'll be dealt with soon enough. He's only on our <br>
  radar because he's been round for so long, nearly a month now. It's unusual for one to stay so long <br>
  from the safety of a nest. Unusual and worrying considering the timing.”<br>
  The Wall stretched out for miles and miles. If the shifters Pride surrounded the entire human <br>
  region<br>
  “How big is fairy territory?”<br>
  “Not as big as you may think. We are solitary by nature and usually travel in mated pairs. Small <br>
  families.”<br>
  “There's nowhere you all get together?”<br>
  “I know what you mean. We have two wylds, the Orchard and the Grove.” He paused, slanted a look my <br>
  way. “You're asking a lot of questions. You believe me now? That I am fairy, that you are fairy.”<br>
  “No,” I blurted. “I'm not I'm not.”<br>
  “You never thought it odd you are able to push your body beyond the normal boundaries of a girl <br>
  your age?”<br>
  I ignored the fact he'd called me a girl, and batted his words away with my hand.<br>
  “I'm stronger, yes. And I'm fast, but I always have been.” I was stretching the truth. I hadn't <br>
  always been fast, but crazy fast.<br>
  “And that's all?”<br>
  My pace slowed to a dazed meander, an aimless weave through the mossy trunks. Swallowing hard, I <br>
  bit my lip and tasted blood. My hand strayed to where the wound from a bullet graze should mark me <br>
  and felt nothing. I had always been a quick healer. Not that quick, but quicker than most. I was <br>
  not like other people because I didn't think or feel the same. I didn't eat right, or feel right <br>
  when people touched me. I got urges, strange urges to I blinked away the sting in my eyes. My mind <br>
  took a frightening and obvious leap of intuition. I stopped. Everything in my world vibrated and <br>
  slid to a canted angle then jerked straight, becoming new and balancing to the truth. I gave myself <br>
   time for the</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="134" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="135" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">largest wave of emotion to subside.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="136" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I am a demon,” I said slowly, testing the words. “I am fairy.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="137" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The world didn't end. No one gasped or cried out, and there was nothing to suggest anything was <br>
  wrong anywhere else in the world in that moment. My entire perception and understanding of <br>
  everything was shifting into a new alignment, but that did not affect anything or anyone but me. My <br>
  eyes were drawn to Breandan's face. We stared at each other. Over the worst of my freak out, I had <br>
  decided to make everything his fault, and I wondered what part of him to hit first.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="138" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His expression turned from wary to amused. “See, you're not surprised. You knew you were <br>
  different.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="139" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I ducked my head to let my hair fall forward and cover my face. “I wish I'd reacted with hysteria <br>
  now, like stabbed you with a stick and run screaming.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="140" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Lips curving he shook his head once. “You're taking this well,” he explained.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="141" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Better than we'd hoped for.” I opened my mouth to ask who this “we” was he kept referring to, but <br>
  he kept on talking. “The world has changed with demons out in the open and the fact you are <br>
  training to be-” His expression hardened briefly. “Your reaction is not what I expected, good, but <br>
  unexpected.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="142" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“What did you think I would do?” He shrugged. “Violence.”<br>
  The word described how I would have expected to react, but I didn't feel aggressive. I was <br>
  exhausted, confused and a little giddy. Maybe I was having a vivid dream, or an outer body <br>
  experience. “Give me longer, I'm working up to it.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="143" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Do you want to talk about it? That helps females.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="144" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His eyes fell from mine as the violence he was waiting for seeped through my calm and poisoned my <br>
  voice. “No.” I threw the word at him with the force of an accusation.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="145" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="146" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I'm sorry.”<br>
  I narrowed my eyes. “You need to work on the whole speaking plainly thing.”<br>
  “The awakening was painful for you.” His mouth twisted around the word. “Your nature should not <br>
  have been released so crudely without you knowing what you truly are. It may seem like I'm being <br>
  cruel with my words, but we don't have a lot of time and now you have broken the spell you will <br>
  find it harder to conceal what you are.”<br>
  It was like he was speaking dead languages to me. One minute, I understood and followed his train <br>
  of thought, the next I was being dunked head first into the sea when I'd thought I was standing in <br>
  a field.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="147" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You're not making any sense. You talk like I already know what you're referring to. And I don't.”<br>
  “Your true form was concealed, a powerful casting. It suppressed and hid your fairy nature to keep <br>
  you safe.”<br>
  I bit my lip. “I really am a fairy too?” “What else would you be?”<br>
  I stopped, and my fingers curled under into fists. “You called me a demon girl. I could be a <br>
  shifter, or have goblin blood or be a witch.” I sniffled. Unattractive, but needed since my nose <br>
  was running. I was still trying not to cry, and the stinging pressure had to be released somehow.<br>
  My voice was muffled and my nose felt thick. “They all look human too.” “Oh, Rae. You look like a <br>
  human because of your glamour.”<br>
  My frustration was replaced with confusion and curiosity. “My glamour?” I waited for him to <br>
  elaborate. He said nothing. I did the only thing I could do and applied logic to try and <br>
  understand. I felt sick.<br>
  “Vampires can do what you describe. Glamour a human when they need to trick and feed.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="148" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="149" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Was that it? I was I some freaky vampire-fairy hybrid that was going to go mad and massacre a load <br>
  of people?<br>
  “No.” His hand cut the air in a strong motion. “What you refer to is purely mind control. The dead <br>
  ones dress up compulsion to make it seem harmless. Fairy glamour is a small enchantment allowing us <br>
  to look completely human.” He placed a hand to his heart, to his lips and reached as if to touch <br>
  me. “Magic to our being is air to breathe and water to drink.”<br>
  The barrier over him rippled again.<br>
  “The glamour is that shield over you.” My hand swiped feebly but the curiosity in my tone was <br>
  evident. “The barrier I can't see through or feel.” His mouth tugged into a secret smile. Then he <br>
  looked back over his shoulder, tapped his foot impatiently. I frowned. “You still need to go after <br>
  the vampire you sensed back there?”<br>
  His face smoothed into relief. “Yes, yes I do.”<br>
  “Then show me. Prove what you are.” I stopped and crossed my arms over my chest. “The quicker you <br>
  do the quicker you can go.”<br>
  Breandan took a long look at me then glowed with an inner light. His face was fiercely beautiful, <br>
  the perfect features sharpened. His ears had elongated, pointed at the tips and curved into a <br>
  slender elliptical shape. He looked different. Other.<br>
  The desire to hold him had increased in pressure, and was a force attacking all angles.<br>
  “Why do I feel like this?” I asked quietly. “I don't think I even like you. How can I feel like <br>
  this? Like I've known you my whole life. When you touch me I feel complete. When you speak, I <br>
  accept everything because you said it.”<br>
  “The feeling of dislike is mutual, but I'm beginning to think I was born for you.” He sighed. “This <br>
  will not be easy. Of course I would be the one to see you first.”<br>
  He pointed to somewhere behind me and turned his head slowly from left to right, like he was <br>
  considering something. I looked over my shoulder. We had reached the Wall and the sudden crackling <br>
  energy in the air allowed me to sense he was doing something big. The red wires stopped humming and <br>
  cooled to</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="150" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="151" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">pewter metal instead blazing red with electricity. The wires pinged and unraveled leaving a hole <br>
  big enough for me to pass through at a stoop.<br>
  He jerked his head toward it. “Go now. Be safe and we will come for you.”<br>
  Then he was gone. Apparently fairies didn't do long goodbyes. He was there then he wasn't.<br>
  I was alone again in the forest but at least I wasn't lost anymore. The sun was nearly done <br>
  creeping up too. I slipped through the hole in the Wall, and the moment I did it knitted back <br>
  together, but not before a dark streak dived through.<br>
  Every hair on my body stood on end. This was no fairy or Cleric. The movement was too liquid and <br>
  quick to belong to anything, but a dead one. All I could think was run. I turned, tripped over a <br>
  tree root and fell flat on my face. A mouth full of dirt, I crawled forward then decided I wanted <br>
  to see it coming rather than be jumped from behind, and flipped round to scuttle back.<br>
  The vampire loomed over me, silent and deadly. He was dressed all in black and the space around him <br>
  pulsed with darkness. Gesturing to me, his fingers were palm up and they curled around the air.<br>
  “Quiet, now,” he said. “It is not what you think. I would have revealed myself in a less dramatic <br>
  manner, but the tear the fairy made was closing, and I did not have another way.” His somber <br>
  expression lightened and his eyes twinkled. “I have already eaten, a skinny girl, bitter.”<br>
  I shrieked and scrambled back some more. My hands were scraped and gouged by stones and bracken, <br>
  but the flares of heat a second after told me I was healing. The vampire followed me, human slow so <br>
  my eyes could track his movement.<br>
  I'd heard they liked to torment their meals. Make them beg and scream for death before putting them <br>
  out of their misery.<br>
  “You are being rude,” he said shortly. “Will you not talk to me?”<br>
  I blinked, astonished, and stopped moving. “Huh,” I grunted, incredulous. “I'm about to die and you <br>
  think I'm being rude by not talking to you?”<br>
  If I was in my right mind I would never back-chat the living dead, but I was shaking with fear and <br>
  pretty sure I was about to pee myself.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="152" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="153" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Back-chat didn't seem bad anymore.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="154" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His face remained passive. “I am death to those who cross my path.” My heartbeat picked up as if to <br>
  emphasize the point. His mouth pulled into a grim line. “I do not deny what I am. I embrace it, but <br>
  I have not come here to hurt you. I told you. I have already eaten.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="155" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I started backing up again. It was stupid me crawling back and he walking after me, but now I was <br>
  over the initial shock, I couldn't get my body to stop. “Forgive me for not wanting to trust you, <br>
  but your kind and my kind haven't exactly seen eye to eye.” As I spoke I wasn't sure if I meant <br>
  humankind or fairykind, but I was sure the relationship with the vampires was about on par.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="156" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His lips quirked then fell straight. “No. I suppose not. Would it help if I gave you my word?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="157" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He stopped and held out a hand to help me up.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="158" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I thought about it and managed to stop crawling. My arms were tired, my ass was damp from being <br>
  dragged across the forest floor, and I was pretty sure I had a spider crawling up my back. I sighed <br>
  and tossed my head to get the hair out of my eyes.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="159" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No, it would not help, but I'm tired of being on the ground, and if you're going to eat me I'd <br>
  rather be upright with my head held high.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="160" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I clasped his hand and curled my fingers around his. They were rock solid, cold. He pulled me up <br>
  and my legs wobbled, so his other hand snagged my waist to steady me. For a moment I stood, but was <br>
  weightless. The sensation was unusual. I scowled and stared into the face of my vampire. He was <br>
  older than me, not by much and he was ugly. Swept back from his forehead and longer than <br>
  fashionable, his hair was coal black, and cut close at the neck. His eyes were red ringed, like he <br>
  was sickly, and had a peculiar stillness about them. He hadn't blinked, not once since he'd first <br>
  revealed himself to me. His eyebrows were thick and dark, as was the smattering of hair on his <br>
  chin, which had a deep cleft. His brow jutted out from his face and his cheeks were gaunt, giving <br>
  him a look of the starved. It was a strong face but one that did not appeal to me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="161" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Straightening, I pulled myself from his grip and knocked his hands away. A faint, dry scent hit <br>
  the back of my throat and my hackles rose. Swallowing hard,</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="163" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">my eyes left his as I controlled the sudden urge to launch myself at him. To rip, bite and tear. A <br>
  manic giggle bubbled in my chest. The thought of launching yourself at a vampire was ridiculous <br>
  and suicidal, but my body was seriously contemplating it. He brushed the hair out of my eyes and I <br>
  recoiled. He hadn't made a move for a vein yet, but he was a blood drinker, and I was full of <br>
  blood. He flashed me a smile, and his chalky lips framed pearly fangs flanked by two smaller <br>
  canines. They had run right out as he'd touched me. For a moment I was overcome. I stared at them, <br>
  the spiky tips resting on his lower lip, a startling shade of ruby red. Everyone knew vampire fangs <br>
  ran out when they were mad or bloodlusty. Which was he? Probably the latter, if he was mad my limbs <br>
  would be scattered across the forest floor by now.<br>
  “You're going to kill me now,” I said steadily.<br>
  I'd been through too much to deny that I was living on borrowed time. To be honest I was waiting <br>
  for the hammer to fall. I would die there, food for the vampire-boy the fairy-boy was hunting. <br>
  Breandan would return eventually, like he promised and find my rotted corpse. Would he be sad? <br>
  Would he and the ‘we’ he'd referred to, lament over my body. Would they give me a proper burial?<br>
  After all he had said I was like him, fairykind too. In my last moments of life pondering on how I <br>
  felt about being named a demon, I did not feel disgust or fear, but sort of a resigned relief. I <br>
  was no longer a freaky human girl, but a demon. My strangeness made perfect sense now.<br>
  “I am not going to kill you.”<br>
  The vampire had spoken. It took me a while to realize he had, because my last words had been a <br>
  statement not a question. And even if he'd interpreted it as a question, it was clearly rhetorical. <br>
  I was living my last moments and the flashbacks of my life were about to commence, so the <br>
  interruption was not appreciated. But since he'd spoken again I felt obliged to say something back, <br>
  and I was getting used to conversations with strangers.<br>
  “Why?” I asked genuinely puzzled. “You didn't dive through that hole for fun. If the wires had <br>
  caught you, you'd have set off the klaxon and had Clerics with stakes and silver on your ass until <br>
  you were ash. Vampires don't seem the self- sacrificing kind to me. Plus, the sun is rising.” I <br>
  pointed east. “You don't have much time, and to be out this early, or late, you must be super <br>
  hungry to risk the true death. Or suicidal. Which brings me back to the fact you guys are big on <br>
  the</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="165" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">self preservation.”<br>
  He made a low rumbling noise and his shoulders shook. It was laughter, and it was gruesome and <br>
  wretched. “I have been looking for you.”<br>
  I thought about this. For a vampire to be looking for you and not hunting you, was unheard of. It <br>
  was intriguing and I knew then curiosity was about to get me into more trouble.<br>
  “You're not the first to try that line today. You demons know how to flatter a<br>
  girl.”<br>
  He growled a little. “Fairies.” He said the word like a curse.<br>
  I sighed again, exaggerating the rise and fall of my shoulders. Fine, my tribulations for the <br>
  morning were not over. I could deal with that, but I needed the safety of Temple walls. The forest <br>
  was no longer comforting, but alien and hostile.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="166" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“If you're not going to eat me would you mind if we walked and talked? I'm tired but have to keep <br>
  going, or I'll be late for class.”<br>
  He remained still and peered past me into the trees. I found it hard to read his face. His <br>
  expression was not worried, but I thought it brooding, or rather, preoccupied with being anxious <br>
  about something.<br>
  “I need to find a dark place. A safe place.”<br>
  The dead and the sunlight didn't mix well. They burned, badly, and burst into extravagant blue and <br>
  red flames. Then their blackened corpses flaked into ash. I could see why he might be anxious to <br>
  find a ‘dark place’ as he put it.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="167" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“My wardrobe is dark.” The words popped out of my mouth before they registered. “Wait,” I said, and <br>
  held up my palm. The standard cracks in my judgment were now gaping canyons, and there were all <br>
  kinds of crazy ideas flying around. “You're friendly, right? If I help you, you aren't going to <br>
  turn on me. Or turn me.”<br>
  “As you rightly pointed out, the sun is rising and I weaken by the moment. I need to talk to you. <br>
  Hear what I have to say then I'll go.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="168" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="169" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Okay,” I said slowly. There did not seem to be too big a downside to this arrangement. “I can do <br>
  that, hear you out. But tell me, the fairy-boy I met is hunting you.” I watched his face carefully. <br>
  “Why? Did you do something bad to him or his kind?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="170" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He looked me over so intently I squirmed in my skin. He made a quick movement with his hand that <br>
  said ‘so what’.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="171" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“If they find my resting place they will kill me, and they won't listen to what I have to say, <br>
  which is why you must.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="172" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I mouthed my next words silently before I spoke them aloud. “I'm a fairy too.” It was easy to say <br>
  and I smiled. “It's important I know if talking to you will get me in trouble.” I paused then <br>
  grunted. “In more trouble than I already am, I mean.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="173" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His eyebrows rose and he focused on me more intently. I backed up a pace and couldn't help cupping <br>
  my neck with my hand. He tilted his head and narrowed those bottomless eyes of his.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="174" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I smell magic, but you seem human to me in every way.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="175" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You seem to know a lot about me and what I've been doing. But then if you knew a lot about me you <br>
  would know I have only just found out I'm a fairy.” That sentence was convoluted, and I had <br>
  confused myself. It made some kind of crazy sense, so I stood my ground and waited for his answer.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="176" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The vampire did not seem confused. “I can explain. But at night.” His eyes darted to the east and <br>
  his mouth pulled down.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="177" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The sky was much lighter now, but the clouds gave extra cover. Time was running out, I was beyond <br>
  terrified, the curls of fear in my stomach were tornadoes, and I felt a responsibility to protect <br>
  this vampire from bursting into a firework display.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="178" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“My cupboard it is.” He placed a hand on my lower back and I jerked away. “Watch the hands,” I said <br>
  and eyed him.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="179" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I'm going to carry you,” he explained. “It will be faster and we will not be seen.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="180" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="181" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He was not much taller than me or bigger in size. No doubt he could carry me, but still, the <br>
  thought of being so close to death itself was worrisome. His presence still rubbed me up the wrong <br>
  way. I was strong willed, not infallible, and me losing control would be fatal.<br>
  “No funny business. I'll scream and dead or not, it will hurt your ears.” He shook his head, face <br>
  serious. “No funny business,” he promised. “Could you put the fangs away?”<br>
  “I like the way you smell.”<br>
  “That is creepy,” I said and plucked at my bottom lip. “You're creepy.”<br>
  His body kind of vibrated, and a strange grizzly sound came out of his mouth. I guess since <br>
  vampires didn't use air to talk or breathe they sounded, moved and even laughed differently to <br>
  normal beings. I jumped, but thankfully he was too preoccupied with laughing to notice, or to <br>
  comment on noticing.<br>
  “No biting. I swear.”<br>
  I was having a hard time. Vampires were more often than not attractive in a scary, dead, don't look <br>
  them straight in the eye, ripping throats out and wallowing in ‘top yourself’ amounts of despair, <br>
  way. This vampire-boy was positively spritely. It was such a stark contrast to my preconceptions <br>
  cultivated by years of Sect reports, I kept having mini flashes of the different ways he would grab <br>
  me, and sink his fangs into my flesh.<br>
  “Can't get much crazier than I already am,” I said finally, and shuddered. Another flash of <br>
  watching him drink me to death had me wishing I'd stayed my ass in bed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="182" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The vampire picked me up and broke out into a ground-eating run. I noticed then that he was not <br>
  breathing and wondered if that was by choice? It was strange to be so close to another person and <br>
  not sense the normal rise and fall of the chest. There was no heartbeat either. No body heat. Just <br>
  this animated body walking and talking and carrying me. People said vampires were soulless, and I <br>
  did not agree. They had souls, dark ones. Here I must say I also believed there were different <br>
  kinds of dark. There was a dark that was evil and cruel, and there was a</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="183" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="184" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">dark that was solitary and simply absent of light. Maybe this boy was the clear dark.<br>
  I kept thinking nice fluffy thoughts of flames that didn't blister the skin because they looked <br>
  pretty, and bolts of lightning that wouldn't kill you dead because they were a gift from the sky. <br>
  Making bad things good helped me to not freak out, and start bawling in this demons embrace. No <br>
  matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop the thought that really mattered. This vampire needed <br>
  something from me. That was the reason I was still alive. And, I concluded he must be cunning. <br>
  Breandan seemed a good tracker and he'd been fooled. I was sure he would not have left me if he'd <br>
  thought there was a chance I'd be in danger.<br>
  Thinking of the fairy-boy had me thinking on a new problem I had created for myself. What did I do <br>
  and say the next time I saw him? Did I tell him about the vampire-boy in the wardrobe? Breandan had <br>
  said he'd come back, but not when so I figured he'd probably give me a few days to adjust. He'd <br>
  seemed very conscious I accept what he'd told me, and he'd made an effort to ask how I was feeling <br>
  and if I'd wanted to talk about it. The vampire could die for the day in my wardrobe, ask me his <br>
  questions after sunset then go on his merry way.<br>
  Problem solved, because then I would wake up.<br>
  I had decided right around the time I saw the green fairy-girl that I was dreaming.<br>
  We ended back on the Temple grounds in a few blinks of the eye. At first it looked like he was <br>
  going to run through the brick wall that surrounded the Temple, and I squeezed my eyes shut. I felt <br>
  a jolt. Air whistled past my head and other sounds drowned in a loud whoosh. The vampire-boy did a <br>
  fast movement, another bigger jolt then the wind was blowing the hair back from my face again. It <br>
  was hard to figure out the speed he ran at in the dark, but the wind on my face gave me a little <br>
  thrill. If ever I needed to run away from him I'd be faster.<br>
  Something struck me as a little odd. He seemed to know exactly where he was going.<br>
  I said, “You've been here before.”<br>
  This was more evidence I was still sleeping safely in my bed. “No. Your scent is distinctive.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="185" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  “Huh. The key is in my left butt pocket,” I said candidly.<br>
  “I see,” he said. We reached my room and he threw me over his shoulder. It was neat, and swift, and <br>
  not a little bit uncomfortable. “May I?”<br>
  “Uh, may you what? May you take the key, or may you drain me for dinner?”<br>
  “You have to invite me in.” He sounded strained. “The hallways are public but your room is private. <br>
  Invite me in.”<br>
  “Sorry, I forgot. I'm a little nervous with this whole thing. I'm still waiting for you to try and <br>
  take a chunk out of me. Sure, go ahead. I invite-Wait. It will only let you in right? The <br>
  invitation won't throw my room wide open to all vampires, I mean.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="186" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Only me. And I cannot extend the invitation to others. Are you satisfied? The night is over.”<br>
  “I invite you to enter my room,” I said and giggled. It sounded so formal.<br>
  There was a light brush against my butt then we were in my room, and he was placing me down on the <br>
  bed.<br>
  “Ta,” I said and fell back, rubbed my face on my blanket. It smelled like trees, rain and sunlight. <br>
  I blinked. It smelled like me, but it also reminded me of Breandan.<br>
  “This is your wardrobe?” My vampire-boy did not sound happy.<br>
  “It's small, but it will do the job.” He shot me a look that on a human face would have been long <br>
  suffering. He was too strange looking to look anything other than intimidating. “Give me a break, <br>
  it's not like this was ever a scenario I'd ever have to prepare for.” I started pulling clothes out <br>
  onto the floor until the space was empty. “There,” I said with satisfaction. The space was big <br>
  enough for two people. He was being prissy. I deliberated for a moment if you could catch anything <br>
  from sharing with a vampire, but then gave myself a mental slap. I chucked my pillow and blanket <br>
  in there and nodded. “Best I can do.”<br>
  The vampire picked up my hand and bent over. My heart stuttered and I flinched. He paused and his <br>
  shoulders shook with laughter again. “No biting,” he</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="187" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="188" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">repeated.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="189" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Keeping eye contact, he flipped my hand over and kissed my palm. The press of his skin to mine was <br>
  almost beyond words. His lips were firm and the tip of his tongue wet. It was odd, cold and overly <br>
  smooth, but not unpleasant. My mouth opened and I made a gasping, choking sound. I blushed from the <br>
  soles of my feet right up to the tip of my ears. I tugged my hand away, hid it behind my back.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="190" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Once you're in I'll close the doors, and no one will be the wiser.” I glanced out the window. <br>
  “You'd better tuck yourself in now. There's a storm, but I can see breaks in the cloud cover.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="191" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He lacked the smooth and predatory movement of vampire as he staggered forward and collapsed into <br>
  the space. We'd pushed our luck too far. He was visibly exhausted, which was fascinating to see on <br>
  one of the most powerful demons in existence. Face shadowed he sighed, shifted a bit, and sat with <br>
  his legs bent in font. He wasn't very tall. It must have just been his scary vampire presence and <br>
  the pulsing darkness following him around that made him seem huge to me. In a very human move he <br>
  propped the pillow to the side and leaned his head.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="192" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“At sunset we will talk.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="193" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I nodded. Pushing the hair out of my eyes I smiled at him. “Sure thing.” I went to close the door, <br>
  but then stopped and yanked it open again. “Oh wait, my name's Rae.”</p>

  The storm broke at dawn. I slipped into the surge of Disciples heading into Sanctuary block as the <br>
  first raindrops hit the ground. Pounding the concrete entrance stairs, I wheeled through the other <br>
  bodies to get to the Hall before the bell rung. I skidded to a stop. Sanctuary Hall had cracked <br>
  black marble floors and scuffed ivory walls. Electricity was hard to generate so the radiators <br>
  stayed off until winter, and the temperature was on the cool side, but I liked it.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="197" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Draped across the clunky furniture, and each other, in erratic clusters the Disciples of the Sect <br>
  wore two colors, black and green. Boys tended to leave their chests bare under the green blazers, <br>
  and the girls rocked them shorn at the elbow or tied around the waist to show off their tattoos. <br>
  Nearly all humans were marked now days; protective sigils coerced from defeated wiccans. I myself <br>
  avoided it. The idea of someone so close made me sweat, no matter how pretty the ink.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="198" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I wondered what would happen if I shouted out “I'm a fairy and there's a vampire in my wardrobe.” <br>
  It would be very dramatic.<br>
  Reflexively, my gaze travelled across the bobbing heads. Alex sat alone at our bench. She noticed <br>
  me and wiggled her fingers, animated by my arrival like I was something special. Rake thin and <br>
  inked from head to toe, Alex confused people when they first saw her. She was too pretty to look at <br>
  straight on and most slid looks her way to digest her beauty like jolts of lightening, rather than <br>
  get a fist in the gut at the sight of her. Long blonde hair and sultry blue eyes contrasted <br>
  startlingly with her deeply tanned skin, a few shades shy of rich chocolate.<br>
  She smiled, and the blue runes prettily decorating her cheekbones crinkled. “Hai,” she said and <br>
  chucked a can at me.<br>
  I caught it one handed and tipped my chin up as thanks. Popping the top, I took a few slurping <br>
  gulps and grinned at her, breakfast done.<br>
  Alex's general attitude to life was, ‘And what?’ She didn't give a damn what people thought of her, <br>
  or what she did. If the upper dwells gave her hell or looked down on her for coming from the slums, <br>
  she'd punch them in the face</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="199" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="200" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">then ask who was next. She took the same approach in her friendships. This was why she was my only <br>
  friend. She didn't care I was a freak since she figured she was already one too.<br>
  Ambling over to our bench, I sat on the table surface and tucked a leg under my butt, left the <br>
  other hanging.<br>
  Stuffing a bread roll into her mouth, Alex pretended to roll her eyes in the back of her head. <br>
  “It's all bad, Rae. Real bad,” she said around her mouthful. “I slept terrible, and there's a bad <br>
  storm coming in. My hair be all static.”<br>
  She made a big hair gesture with her hands.<br>
  Overly excited or emotional, Alex tended to slip deeper into her colloquial roots to twang like <br>
  crazy. I used to have to concentrate on what she was saying when we first enrolled, her slum speak <br>
  was one of the most broken and slow I'd ever heard, but after a year or so I understood her babble <br>
  easy.<br>
  Relaying the horror of how a third grade had tried to ask her out, but puked, she paused to screw <br>
  her eyes up. “S'up with you? You look all shiny and more frazzled than usual.”<br>
  I should take up cards because my face didn't twitch. Keeping a neutral expression I shrugged. “Not <br>
  that much.”<br>
  Her eyebrow climbed. Maybe my face was a little too composed. “You gonna share or keep evading? <br>
  Don't make me beat it out of you. I went to your room this morning to eat breakfast, but you <br>
  weren't there. Where you go? I tore this place up looking.” She leaned in, her voice hinting at <br>
  naughtiness as she said, “You do something prohibited?”<br>
  My gaze flicked to then from hers, down to the floor. “I met a boy,” I said and felt my cheeks <br>
  warm.<br>
  Gods, could I have not managed anything better? I knew what she'd think I'd been doing.<br>
  “I knew it, a secret rendezvous. Tell me. Is it Jono? He's an ass, but I won't mind if you like <br>
  him. Honest. Zoe has her she-devil eyes on him but he's had a big thing for you for months.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="201" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="202" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I ignored the comment, held down a sigh. “You won't understand.”<br>
  “What's not to understand? I don't mind who you fool with.” She slid a considering look my way. <br>
  “That is, as long as it's not Ro.”<br>
  I rubbed at my scratchy eyes and pushed some hair out of my face. Taking a second to think on it, I <br>
  decided it'd cause no harm to tell a little more of what happened. “This morning, I went for a run <br>
  and I-” I frowned and searched for words that wouldn't make her freak out. Alex had a penchant for <br>
  the melodramatic. “This boy,” I said and flushed when I thought of Breandan. “He bumped into me. <br>
  Or rather I bumped into him since he seemed to expect me. It was the weirdest feeling, like I was <br>
  meant to be with him.”<br>
  “Was he familiar? Someone you'd met in the upper dwells, perhaps.” She sounded suspicious.<br>
  I couldn't help but smile at comparing the magnificent mental image of Breandan, next to one of the <br>
  skinny, pot-hole-faced pubescent boys the dwells produced in an alarming quantity considering the <br>
  human race was near extinction.<br>
  “No. He was not from the slums either before you ask. His name's Breandan.”<br>
  “Hold up.” She pinched the bridge of her nose then rubbed at the runes on her cheek. This told me <br>
  she was agitated and I braced myself for a lecture. “This boy you met was Outside, as in beyond <br>
  the Wall?”<br>
  Fiddling with the skin peeking through a slash in my jeans, I nodded. “I know what you're thinking <br>
  but it's fine. Do not tell anybody. I'm dealing with it.”<br>
  Her eyes widened and I realized my mistake. “You know what he is don't you? What kind of demon he <br>
  is.” I said nothing. To open my mouth at such a point would be a bad thing. I'd already told her <br>
  much more than I had meant to. But it was nice to tell someone, who would not think I was <br>
  clinically insane, and release some pressure.<br>
  “You know I won't tell anybody, but you need to never go out there again.”<br>
  She looked worried, but I couldn't help but add, “He touched me, held my hand and I'd wanted him <br>
  to.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="203" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="204" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It would have sounded stupid to the average person, and if it had been anyone but Alex, I would <br>
  have kept my mouth shut.<br>
  As little as I'd told her, Alex's mouth popped open. “No lie, touching? You willingly placed your <br>
  hand in another? Like actual skin contact.”<br>
  As much as I wanted to, I couldn't tell her what really happened with the fairy- boy. It was weird, <br>
  admittedly not weirder than the vampire slumbering in my wardrobe, but still pretty messed up. Even <br>
  if I tried to tell her the boy was a fairy she'd take me to get my head checked. If I said the word <br>
  ‘vampire’ she'd probably hit the klaxon as a reflex.<br>
  “Only you could make a demon friend,” she said, and to my amazement sounded jealous.<br>
  I placed a finger on my lips and shot her a look. Did she want the whole world to know?<br>
  “Keep it down, I was safe.” She peered at me, seeking the truth and I composed my face to blank. It <br>
  wasn't a lie per se. I just didn't divulge all details that no doubt would horrify her. “I guess <br>
  you could call him a friend,” I said slowly. “I don't think he'd ever hurt me in fact he helped me <br>
  out of a pretty tight jam. I only told you so much because it was odd, and you would've bugged me <br>
  until I told you something semi believable.”<br>
  I shrugged to give the impression of nonchalance.<br>
  She was not convinced, and her pinched face told me so. “You gonna get yourself dead. I told you <br>
  to forget about that damn hole. I should've made you tell a Cleric.”<br>
  My voice was flat when I replied, “Whoever he was, he's long gone.” Drumming her nails on the table <br>
  she shrugged. “Say-so. Let's move.”<br>
  She went to grab my hand but I flinched. Rolling her eyes, she grabbed my blazer lapel instead and <br>
  dragged me behind her.<br>
  Half way down the hall the morning bell rung and the corridor filled with bodies.</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="206" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I gripped the strap of my bag tightly. I knew I had a class, I'd spent all morning trying to get <br>

  period?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="207" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Demon Theory,” Alex shot over her shoulder.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="208" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A jaw-cracker of a yawn took me by surprise, and I shook off a little sleepiness. Damn straight I <br>
  was on my way to class even after my pre dawn drama. I could not skip class; the punishment was not <br>
  worth it. I was pretty much good at everything I tried and took eight classes instead of the six <br>
  most Disciples preferred; Martial Arts, Explosives, Subterfuge, Entomology, Demon Theory, <br>
  Equestrianism and Alchemy. I was tired, and could feel a grump coming on, but I vowed to keep it <br>
  together a few more hours for the sake of maintaining. My plan was to get through the day with my <br>
  head down, deal with the dead thing in my closet then sleep and wake up to everything being back to <br>
  normal. Rather, as normal as they were before.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="209" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Alex caught my yawn. “That must have been some run.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="210" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I nodded faintly. Someone pushed past and bashed my shoulder. I winced. I got another shoulder bash <br>
  after two more steps and became freaky alert. I hated walking the halls during period changes. <br>
  Usually I'd be early or late to class and avoid the masses, but Alex liked to be on time.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="211" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I hung my head and lowered my voice. “The next person to touch me is going to be in a world of <br>
  pain.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="212" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">She sent me a consolatory look then shrugged. There wasn't much of anything you could say to make <br>
  someone like me feel better.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="213" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I'd always had problems with getting close to other people. Physical contact made my skin crawl. I <br>
  could only bear to be a more than a foot close for a few seconds before some peculiar reflex took <br>
  over, and this horrible hissing noise started to break from my throat. It was embarrassing and <br>
  practically a disability. As I child my blood had been tested a gazillion times because the Sect <br>
  suspected I had demon blood, but the tests always came back negative for shifter or witch genes. <br>
  The month people thought I was a witch was bad, and if I'm honest the worst of my life. Freaky and <br>
  unexplainable stuff started happening when I was nearby. Naturally, the solution thought up by the <br>
  community was to blame the weird kid. Having no family to protect me I had been mocked, beaten to a <br>
  pulp</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="214" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="215" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">and ridiculed. People had spat at me and even thrown stones. The matrons at the orphanage were <br>
  afraid of me and did nothing; they probably hoped someone would kick me in the head too hard and <br>
  take me off their hands. But I'd always been resilient and a quick healer. Bearing the burden of <br>
  being hated and feared had set me apart as strong, and the Sect enrolled me in the Cleric training <br>
  programme less than a season later.<br>
  As a Disciple my life was better, still difficult but better. I even had friend now.<br>
  Walking into the class, ignoring the other Disciples already in the room, I sat down and rested my <br>
  cheek on my palm as Alex wandered off to mingle.<br>
  Mind drifting, a memory of silver eyes had my heart picking up speed and turned my breathing <br>
  shallow. Feeling the heat in my cheeks, a glance around showed everyone was too wrapped in their <br>
  own world to notice my heaving chest. Not that people paid me much mind. Why was I getting all hot <br>
  and heavy over a fairy-boy I would never see again? He said he was going to come for me, and I had <br>
  used this to help me get through my encounter with the vampire, but there was no way he would risk <br>
  coming onto the Temple grounds. That would be stupid, and Breandan seemed anything but stupid, <br>
  right?<br>
  Bored of waiting for the lesson to start, I stood to stretch, and the satisfying pangs of my <br>
  muscles loosening helped chase away some of the dull drum. Wandering from my desk, I twisted my <br>
  fingers together and paced the room. There had to be something to inspire a break of remembering <br>
  those cold and mad eyes. Why was he mad? He was definitely upset about having to help me back to <br>
  the Temple, but why?<br>
  There was no way in hell I was ever stepping another toe past the Wall ever again, so I had to stop <br>
  tormenting myself with the questions eating away at my composure. Questions like who was he? Who <br>
  were the ‘we’ he kept referring to and how did he know I was a fairy? Why was I given up at birth? <br>
  Were my parents still alive?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="216" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I thought I would go mad. If only I could see him one more time, talk to him again, I might <br>
  actually learn something instead of being left confused and uneasy.<br>
  Glancing out the window I did a double take. Calm and still, a figure stood on the grass outside. <br>
  Breandan stared at me. His eyes followed my steps as the wind</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="217" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="218" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">and rain lashed his body. He'd found me, and he did not look happy. What could I have possibly done <br>
  to make him more upset? Lifting a hand he held it out, and crooked a finger. Pulled as if tethered, <br>
  I took a step forward then another. His eyes widened, face became troubled. He beckoned to me again <br>
  but waved his whole hand. My pace quickened into a skip in my hurry to reach him. I fully intended <br>
  on smashing through the wall and glass.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="219" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Colliding head first into a chest, I staggered back. “Excuse me,” I mumbled and cringed all over.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="220" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Body contact was difficult for me when I was focused and prepared. Unexpected, it was like <br>
  experiencing a full body hiccup.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="221" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Forced to spare a glance at the boy I bumped, I felt a thrill at the heart shaped face and green <br>
  eyes watching me. It was my lucky day because he was the third boy I'd seen that morning who was <br>
  delightful to look at. The thought had me veering of course. Breandan was beautiful; he was a <br>
  fairy, which was one of the more attractive demons in existence. The only other boy I'd seen was <br>
  the vampire-boy, Tomas. Did I really think a dead guy was attractive? Hadn't I already decided his <br>
  look did not appeal to me? Uh, what a nasty thought. I shouldn't find a blood drinker sexy.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="222" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I reeled myself back in and focused. Devlin, the boy I had headbutted, was a Disciple like me. He <br>
  was smart, quick and strong, as most of us were, but he was also popular. The kind of Cleric in <br>
  training the Priests like to parade around the civilians to inspire hope and obedience. He'd <br>
  started about a month ago and was pretty much perfect at everything he did. He was adored by the <br>
  girls and worshiped by the teaching Clerics. Strangely enough, he had always tried to talk to me <br>
  and be nice. I'd never paid attention and ignored him because the friendliness had always seemed, <br>
  forced, and had an undercurrent of falsehood.<br>
  But still, I smiled back when he grinned at me, or bobbed my head when we past in the hallway since <br>
  he made a big show of saying hai. Most didn't understand his interest in me, and for a while I'd <br>
  been higher on everyone's radar, but after a week or so things returned to normal. When I say <br>
  normal, I mean I ignored everyone and everyone ignored me. Devlin remained perfect and gorgeous, of <br>
  course.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="223" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His blonde hair so light it was white, and when he smiled I had to blink. “You are excused,” he <br>
  said and an expression flickered across his face too fast for me</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="224" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="225" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">to catch.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="226" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">At his steady appraisal I became flustered, but I did remember I needed to get outside. I navigated <br>
  around him then faltered. The space outside was empty.<br>
  Rushing to the windowsill, I pressed my face to the glass and turned my head at every angle. There <br>
  was nothing but well-tended grounds, Northhouse - the boy's dormitories - and the outer wall <br>
  snaking around the Temple. Crushing disappointment shook me up. Stomping back to my seat I knocked <br>
  into someone as I sat down. I focused on my lap and sucked it up; trying to figure out if I'd lost <br>
  my mind before the next period started. A difficult task when I was not sure I was fully sane to <br>
  begin with. Maybe I'd cracked at some point but hadn't recognized it yet.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="227" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Alex yanked out her seat, dumped her bag and slid into a chair beside me as the bell chimed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="228" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Pulling myself together, I knew I needed to show good manners, and looked over my shoulder with an <br>
  apology for the person I had knocked. I stiffened then looked forward, but the damage was already <br>
  done. Not feeling up for a confrontation, I tried to make myself as small as possible in my seat. <br>
  You know how people say if you stand up to bullies they'll back down, leave you alone, and show <br>
  respect? It's a load of bull in my experience. I stood up to Zoe on my<br>
  first day; I wasn't a pushover after all. She'd never laid a finger on me again, but swapped <br>
  physical beatings for mental torture. Zoe was a large, sharp, pain in my ass. I wanted to be left <br>
  alone to do my own thing, but she couldn't help but make me feel more like a misfit. I peeked to <br>
  see if she was going to start something.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="229" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">She glared at me, her heavily freckled face twisted. “Reject,” she spat dragging a brush through <br>
  masses of over dyed purple hair. Her sleeve fell down with the stroke and I saw she'd been marked <br>
  now, a snake eating its own tail wrapped around her wrist.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="230" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Alex heard her, and whilst I sunk further down in my seat, she twisted round to flip the finger so <br>
  forcefully the table rocked. She added a mouthed ‘screw you’ for good measure.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="231" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You see her mark?” Alex said in a low aside to me. “Takes more than the power of the Ouroboros to <br>
  purify a she-devil.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="232" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">This exchange hadn't gone unnoticed, and the other Disciples turned to look at</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="233" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="234" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">me. My morning was slowly tumbling into hell, and my best friend was not helping. Alex was older <br>
  than me in age not maturity. She'd turned twenty a few months before and was a few weeks behind me <br>
  in classes. I had hoped she would take the final exam the same time as me so we could go over to <br>
  the Temple together. It wouldn't happen if she failed her physical. She'd have to retake the whole <br>
  of grade six, and I didn't want to have to fail another exam to keep pace with her.<br>
  A milky brown skinned boy with thick cornrows threw a wad of paper at the back of Zoe's head. “Not <br>
  cool, Zo. Leave her be.” His black-rimmed eyes looked overly large in his thin face, and his <br>
  blazer hung open to show his naked chest, belly piercing and marks. Jeans worn and slashed at the <br>
  knee, his boots were scuffed and unlaced.<br>
  I smiled warmly. “Hai, Ro. Where have you been?”<br>
  “Slums, on assignment,” he replied. His eyes were on Alex who now stared at the table.<br>
  I twisted round further in my seat and bit my lip. I had loads of questions I wanted to ask. The <br>
  slums were melting pots of every religion, race and minority you could think of. So intermixed <br>
  there was little distinction between skin colors. Occasionally you got the odd throw backs, like <br>
  Alex, who were dark and some, were pale or oriental in appearance and feature, but most were a <br>
  creamy tan.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="235" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Slum shacks were shabby structures tacked onto old buildings. Made from wood, plastics, metal <br>
  basically any material you could get your hands on. Nothing was wasted but then nothing was fixed <br>
  either. The result was a mish- mash of junk and bric-a-brac homes, riddled with drug dens and <br>
  whorehouses. The occasional Sect church stood out like a bleeding human in a hungry vampire nest. <br>
  The Sect took over the churches and gutted the insides to fill them with literature preaching the <br>
  Doctrine that kept us safe. The luxuries held in Sect churches, like books, candles and fabric were <br>
  never stolen. Not unless you wanted to be stung up naked outside the Wall for a hungry demon to <br>
  come teach you a fatal lesson.<br>
  As bad as the slums were, it was the place where the most talented and down to earth people lived. <br>
  For every drug dealer selling stammers, the most popular</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="236" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="237" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">narcotic of choice since the Rupture since it suppressed the appetite, there was a talented <br>
  musician strumming a tune and singing a song. For every streetwalker there was a crew of dancers <br>
  doing their thing. Artists drew on the floors and sides of buildings with chunks of rough chalk, <br>
  knowing that rains that came every day would wash it away, but still happy to sketch all day long. <br>
  Yeah, there was good in the slums. As Disciples we had no spare time, and only got to leave the <br>
  Temple grounds to either train or complete an assignment. I'd only ever had one that had taken me <br>
  into the heart of the slums. I'd been dying to go back ever since.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="238" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Ro saw all the questions on my face and winked at me. “We talk all about it later and I say hai <br>
  proper,” he said.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="239" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It didn't take long for my mind to wander. The fairy-boy from that morning was running around the <br>
  Temple looking for me, waiting for me. I hoped no one else saw him. No human could appear and <br>
  disappear without a trace so quickly, and it would be clear he was ‘other’. That he was a demon <br>
  that had managed to get around the Wall without tripping the klaxon; after all I'd done it too. The <br>
  thought of him being discovered was making me feel slightly sick. I even threw up in my mouth a <br>
  little.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="240" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I heard, rather than saw Cleric Tu step into the room. I knew what he'd look like from memory. His <br>
  hair was a messy confusion of dark curls, and his shoulders were broad. He was young, cheerful and <br>
  nice to look at. He was also a murderer. Few would call him that since most humans would see the <br>
  death of a demon as belated justice, even the death of a demon-child.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="241" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I took a deep breath and looked up. It wasn't so bad. I didn't recoil or blanch at the sight of <br>
  him. My stomach turned over but no one could see that.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="242" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Perched on the edge of his desk, he took a crunching bite of apple. My mouth watered. An apple? <br>
  Fruit. Where the hell had he gotten that? He definitely had friends in high places, because there <br>
  weren't many fruit bearing trees inside the Wall, and getting any fresh produce was rare. Our <br>
  dietary staples were caffeine, sugar and bread. There were few people wandering around who were not <br>
  emancipated looking, and it was usually a sure sign the person was a Priest or related to one. Only <br>
  they could afford to eat enough to be anything other than thin. Maybe it was like a bonus scheme. <br>
  Kill a demon-child and get an apple.<br>
  Chucking his crimson blazer and satchel behind him, he smiled, stretched, and a</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="243" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="244" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">few girls and guys sighed as the muscles on his torso rippled under his thin tunic.<br>
  “Who can tell me the standard attributes of identifying a demon?” he asked. Dead silence was broken <br>
  by a giggle, and the squeak of a shifting chair. His eyebrows rose high at the lack of enthusiasm, <br>
  mouth pulling down. “Don't make me pick you one by one.”<br>
  A few hands climbed lazily.<br>
  I was too busy doodling a picture of silver eyes on my notepad to lift mine. Hs eyes had calmed me <br>
  down that morning when I was half out of my mind. Maybe on paper they could help too.<br>
  “Yes, Jono,” Tu said.<br>
  “Vampires,” Jono, a decent looking boy from the upper dwells, began and pushed his glasses up the <br>
  bridge of his crooked nose, “have a body temperature below fifteen, descendible canine teeth, fixed <br>
  cellular activity and the appetite for plasma most easily found in-”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="245" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Aint it cruel to call them demons?” Alex cut in thoughtfully. “It be like the vampires calling us <br>
  bloodsacks.”<br>
  Jono sent a scathing look her way, continued as if she hadn't spoken, “Shifters, can change to a <br>
  single other form and this metamorphosis tends to present itself during-”<br>
  “Why we humans always gotta be placing names on things,” she added after a few beats.<br>
  “Then there are witches,” said Jono through his teeth, face twisted sourly, “Who can be male or <br>
  female, and manipulate matter with the power of-”<br>
  “They evil and that's that,” Ro told Alex and sent her a slow smile. “What else we call them?”<br>
  “I'm speaking,” Jono spat, his glare switching between the both of them.<br>
  Alex dragged her eyes from Ro's chest and glared at Jono. “Dwells,” she muttered. “Think reading <br>
  and writing good makes you better than us.” Tipping</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="246" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="247" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">her chin up, her voice rose. “I got as much right to talk as you do.” He sneered at her. “Life <br>
  sucking mambo.”<br>
  She lurched up, knocked her seat over and waved him forward. “You talk much. Let us see how you do <br>
  with no teeth.”<br>
  Mambos were the name of voodoo Sorcerers eradicated by the Sect nearly a decade before. It was well <br>
  known that Alex's mother had dabbled in black magic, and was whispered that not only had she <br>
  dabbled, but was a proficient Sorceress of the craft. Her dark past was not something the upper <br>
  dwells let Alex forget, and though she did not embrace her origins, she didn't deny them either.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="248" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The sound of Tu slamming his fist on a desk cut above the shouts of encouragement from the other <br>
  Disciples. “Show disrespect to the slum dwells and you disrespect me,” he said and made eye contact <br>
  with everyone. “Anybody does it again and we'll have a problem. Alex, cool it. “<br>
  Setting her chair right, Alex sat back down and shot daggers at everybody, mumbling obscenities <br>
  under her breath. I caught her eye and saw the tears there. I wasn't the only one, for Jono <br>
  flushed, the colour spreading out from his cheeks to kiss his hairline and darken his neck.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="249" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Satisfied the peace had been restored, Tu's handsome face returned to its normal cheerful mien. <br>
  “Carry on,” he said.<br>
  “Of course, Lord Cleric,” Jono replied somberly.<br>
  Ro, not one to forgive and forget, mimed a neck slicing action at him. He would have to watch his <br>
  step in the days to come. Ro had come from the slums too, born into one of the gang families who <br>
  were rumored to have a Bokor in their ranks; a man with white hair who called malevolent corpses <br>
  back from the grave. I myself thought it was simply the skewed reputation of an old man who was <br>
  good with herbs and medicine, as did the Temple Priests. The slums had been searched for <br>
  practitioners of witchcraft and black magic, and none had been found.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="250" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“The last is goblin,” Jono continued in a somewhat humbler voice than before. “The gene presents <br>
  itself from conception and is visible from birth.<br>
  Disfigurement of the humanoid form can vary from slight to severe. Goblins</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="251" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="252" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">show increased strength and animal like senses, but have notably low levels of intelligence.”<br>
  I rolled my eyes. Demon species classification was easy; a panhandler could have told Tu that <br>
  information. After all, you should know the full extent of how screwed you were if a demon managed <br>
  to breach the Wall and cross your path, apart from me, of course. I took a long moment to feel <br>
  special then scolded myself, because my situation was dangerous and creepy, not special.<br>
  “Impressive,” Tu said dryly. “But I think you'll find you forgot one.”<br>
  Jono looked confused. “I named all demons known to man.” He flicked a page of his textbook. His <br>
  eyes widened and he pushed the book away. “I named all real demons; I didn't think we needed to <br>
  reference extinct species. Should I have mentioned the silver backed ape as well?”<br>
  A smattering of Disciples laughed, but I found nothing funny about it. So many animals had been <br>
  lost during the Rupture. During the fighting it seemed everyone forgot that there were other <br>
  creatures than the ones that could talk, and be heard by fighting back. Nevertheless, intrigued <br>
  like others around me, I flicked to the relevant chapter in my book. I paused and scanned the <br>
  summary of demons, and my eyes snagged on the name.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="253" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Tu said, “Fairy. There have been eighty-seven recorded sightings of creatures with humanoid <br>
  appearance in the last year.”<br>
  I stifled a little bubble of hysteria. A grin stretched my face until I thought my lips would split <br>
  down the middle. Alex sent me an odd look, and quirked her eyebrow as if to ask ‘what's so funny?’ <br>
  I pulled my face together and waved her away.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="254" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Lord Cleric, you're asking us to consider fairies flying around the region sprinkling dust and <br>
  spouting riddles?” Jono's was incredulous. “They're practically extinct.”<br>
  Ro snorted a laugh and it smothered out the wild giggle I couldn't seem to contain.<br>
  “I think on it, and can't believe it,” he said. “No Cleric has confirmed sighting of a fairy.” <br>
  Flicking the side of his nose a few times with his thumb, he snorted</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="255" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  again.<br>
  He caught Alex watching him from the corner of her eye and winked. She fought a smile. Looked like <br>
  they were going to make up and play nice again. Ro was a complicated endeavor that Alex could not <br>
  seem to get a handle on. They were always breaking up, seeing other people then coming back <br>
  together again. Ro liked Alex, a lot, but he liked guys too, and it seemed to be something she <br>
  couldn't get her head around.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="256" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The class kept up this train of topic for a while and I tuned out, lazily scratching pictures into <br>
  the table surface with my pen cap.<br>
  “That's an interesting necklace you have on,” said a hushed voice.<br>
  My hand slid to cover the leather tie and circular golden pendant that hung from it. Devlin was <br>
  leaning out of his chair, closer to me.<br>
  “Ta,” I said and turned back around. He moved closer. I shifted away and tried to focus on what Ro <br>
  was saying, but he wasn't finished.<br>
  “Can I see it?”<br>
  “No,” I answered frankly without looking at him. “It's important to you.”<br>
  “Yes.”<br>
  “May I ask why?”<br>
  He was not getting that arms crossed, face turned away signaled I did not want to talk. Scowling, I <br>
  faced him. “It's all I have from my past.”<br>
  He gave me an apologetic look. “It reminds you of your family.”<br>
  I smiled tightly. “It reminds me every day that people can throw you away like trash, and to trust <br>
  no one but yourself.”<br>
  “You sound bitter,” he said thoughtfully.<br>
  “Yeah, well.” I was done with the conversation. I turned away again, slid deeper</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="257" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="258" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">into my chair but found my hand rising. Tu signaled to me with a nod. “Sorry if this is random, I <br>
  haven't been following the conversation.” I shot a pointed look at Devlin. “Why all of a sudden are <br>
  we focusing on fairies? I've noticed my classes in the last month keep picking it up as the main <br>
  study topic.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="259" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“We have orders to increase your training on lesser known beings, in particular fairies. There has <br>
  been increased activity and sightings near the Wall.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="260" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My heart tripped a little in my chest. “Increased?” “Forty in the last month.”<br>
  “Where?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="261" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Tu's gaze bored into mine. “Here, around the Temple.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="262" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I swallowed and scrunched my hands into fists on my knees. The silence thickened, and several sharp <br>
  intakes of breath sounded throughout the room.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="263" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Do we know why?” asked Devlin.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="264" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No,” Tu replied. “But we can make an educated guess. This is where the greatest protectors of our <br>
  race are trained. A demon gaining access to this Temple would be disastrous. They know this, and <br>
  since we first came here we've suffered the odd attack.” He pushed his hands out in an open and <br>
  calming gesture. “And that is why you should not worry. Every attack made by a demon on this Temple <br>
  has failed. The Wall keeps us safe, and when it is breached we erase the danger.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="265" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He paused and paced back and forth across the classroom floor, hands behind his back, and his eyes <br>
  on the floor. His face had become drawn, dark. Is that what he thought he'd done earlier, erased a <br>
  danger? My stomach lurched as my eyes wandered over his crimson blazer. It was hard to look at him <br>
  straight. I wanted to stand and shout and point and tell everyone how sick and twisted he was.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="266" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Tell me, how you would identify a fairy?” he asked as if plucking the question from the air.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="267" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Textbooks say fairies are the most diverse of all demon kind,” Jono started. “Some have bright <br>
  colored hair and funny colored eyes but all are noted to have</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="268" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="269" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">an in-depth connection with nature, and possess inhuman strength, speed and regenerative ability.” <br>
  Jono's mouth opened, breathing in deeply, no doubt about to spew more statistical nonsense.<br>
  My hand shot up.<br>
  Dark eyebrows climbing at the forceful thrust of my hand, Tu jerked his chin at me. “Rae, you have <br>
  something else to add?” There was faint surprise in his tone.<br>
  I could admit I was a more sit in silence then ace all my exams type. But just looking at him had <br>
  all sorts of questions swirling around my mind.<br>
  “Lord Cleric,” I said thickly then had to grunt a few times to clear my windpipe, for bile had <br>
  risen at having to address this man with the honorific. “I know despite the reports of sightings <br>
  that fairies are rare, but have Have you ever seen one? Up close, I mean? “<br>
  He stopped pacing, and his mouth opened then closed. He stared at me hard before rubbing a large <br>
  hand over his face. “No. I have never seen a fairy. They are incredibly rare demons.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="270" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I cocked my head and my mouth won out over logic. “Have the Clerics ever caught a fairy? They hunt <br>
  vampires and shifters all the time, but I've never heard of them actually catching that particular <br>
  type of demon.”<br>
  From the corner of my eye I saw Devlin shift in his chair. I was not surprised. People didn't <br>
  question Clerics like this. The only reason I was managing it is because I'd seen Tu in his most <br>
  base form. He had lost all my respect so it was nothing to talk to him as an equal.<br>
  His eyes went wild, glassy with repressed panic. Could no one else see it? “Like I said they are so <br>
  rare-”<br>
  The direction of my thought changed abruptly, “If they haven't,” I interrupted and tapped Alex's <br>
  textbook with a finger, “how does the Sect know to put such detail in our books?”<br>
  Now I'd looked, they'd even described different variations of fairy coloring. Once you'd seen it, <br>
  it was so striking it was not something you could ever forget. How could the Sect know that, and <br>
  why had I not noticed before?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="271" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="272" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His eyes darted to and from mine. He placed his palms up, pushed them out. “Such beings are <br>
  commonly-”<br>
  My mind flashed to the fairy in the clearing, all that blood and sizzling skin. The ruthless way he <br>
  had behaved made my gut churn and my expression darken. “The Sect is lying.” Someone to my left <br>
  made a choking sound of disbelief. “They must have studied these demons, and for some reason you <br>
  don't want us to-”<br>
  Tu slammed his beefy hand on the desk. “Enough,” he barked. I jumped, snapped my mouth shut.<br>
  Stunned at his own outburst, he blustered around with some papers on his desk and cleared his <br>
  throat. “That is enough on this subject for today.” His voice was quiet, distracted. “Team up and <br>
  turn to page sixteen of your textbooks to discuss and summarize the proposed vampire reproduction. <br>
  Start. I'll be back shortly to check your progress.” He spun on his heel, avoided looking at me and <br>
  left the class.<br>
  Snapped from my single-minded quest for truth, I flushed at the number of people staring at me. I <br>
  shot a look at Alex who was wide eyed, pouty mouth hanging with a chocolate bar resting on her <br>
  bottom lip. It was foolish for me to call such attention to myself, and plain stupid to insult the <br>
  Sect. Pulling my hood up, I breathed out, and tried think of a reasonable explanation for my <br>
  behavior.<br>
  Skipping out of class wouldn't help; it would confirm any suspicions. Tu was one of the Clerics who <br>
  had hunted me this morning. No doubt he was on his way to inform the others of my weird behavior <br>
  and the direction of my questions.<br>
  Great, talk about staying under the radar.<br>
  A sharp pain on my arm made me yelp. Alex's face popped into view. “Damn, Rae. You zoned hard.”<br>
  “What class is next?” I asked. I wondered if I should consider ditching. If the Clerics thought I <br>
  was a danger maybe I needed to leave now. If they found out I was a demon Wait. How would they ever <br>
  know that? Gods, I was becoming melodramatic.<br>
  “We got Subterfuge,” Alex replied, “but I might ditch.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="273" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="274" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I eyed her like she'd lost it. Why would she do that on a whim? Disciples who were caught ditching <br>
  had to do bereavement duty. It meant helping the morgue deal with the remains of any poor <br>
  misfortunate's that got taken out by demons who'd breached the Wall. You helped cremate dead bodies <br>
  and notified any next of kin. Most times it was kids who'd stayed out too late, or had simply been <br>
  in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was the Clerics duty to protect, and when they failed they <br>
  made sure they grieved with the families, and showed them respect. I only considered it because my <br>
  life might be on the line.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="275" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The class divided up into little clicks and Ro came over. He made a silly face at me then grinned. <br>
  I built myself up mentally, knowing what was about to come next. Hauling me up, he wrapped his <br>
  arms around mine and kissed my cheek. “I missed you, Rae.” He was several heads taller than me, and <br>
  my feet lifted from the floor as he squeezed. Roland, Alex's on off steady, was nice. He'd always <br>
  talk to me if he saw me around the compound even when he and Alex were on outs. I wouldn't call him <br>
  a friend since I only knew him and maintained a relationship because he was important to Alex.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="276" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">And that's why I let him hug me, didn't punch him in the face and said, “You too.” I shifted, a <br>
  subtle signal for him to let go, but he remained uncomfortably close. I extracted myself. “How was <br>
  it? The assignment, I mean.”<br>
  I was genuinely curious. I hadn't lived in the slums before I came to the Academy. I had been tied <br>
  to the Sect since birth, and held in orphanages in the upper dwells. I was one of the lucky ones. <br>
  Those without parents generally became panhandlers, beggars prey for any hungry demons that hid <br>
  behind the Wall. Plus, I loved the creative atmosphere of the place.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="277" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“A goblin kid hid in a shack close to the Sect church, a simple catch and release.” He shrugged, <br>
  shifted on the spot. “Same old thing. Dirty and cold, but it be my home, y'know?” He paused and <br>
  made a clicking noise with his tongue, a sound one made unconsciously before bringing up a touchy <br>
  or dangerous subject. It was a slum dwell habit I knew he'd been trying to get rid of for a while. <br>
  “Something happened to you this morning?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="278" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I pressed my lips together. Ro was perceptive, more than was usual for a boy his age. That or I <br>
  looked worse than I thought. I worked hard to keep most of the kooky crap I did away from Alex. It <br>
  would only worry her. The stuff from this morning would probably give her grey hairs. Ro looked <br>
  like he was ready to</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="279" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="280" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">buckle down and figure what was wrong with me. Maybe his well timed words and snorts earlier were <br>
  trying to accomplish more than just derision. Maybe he was trying to cover up the fact I was <br>
  giggling like a banshee during what was supposed to be a serious discussion. Whatever issues I had <br>
  about how cooped up we were behind the Wall or how purist the teachings of Sect had become, the <br>
  Temple was my home. Suggestions bound to get me into serious trouble stayed locked firmly inside my <br>
  mind, most of the time. Disciples who'd voiced radical ideas like my own ended up failing the final <br>
  exam or kicked out of the Sect.<br>
  Then there were the ones who disappeared entirely. That was not going to happen to me. Ro and I had <br>
  had a few very brief discussions about this. Touched on the subject more than once, how some <br>
  things the Sect did and said didn't quite add up. How Disciples going missing, after they had <br>
  spoken up about the treatment of demons we captured, was just plain wrong. Ro had always been keen <br>
  to talk more, but I'd always pulled back.<br>
  “I went Outside,” I said and lifted my chin. “I ran in the forest.”<br>
  Alex groaned and plucked at the skin of her throat as if it irritated her. She'd already known this <br>
  and her reaction was purely knee jerk.<br>
  Ro didn't look surprised, if anything mildly impressed. “Did something happen?”<br>
  I tilted my head, hearing something unspoken in the words. “Why’d you think that?”<br>
  “You on edge, and earlier you went pale like you seen you a ghost. You got so shook up you forgot <br>
  yourself and walked right into Devlin. Rae, you always so careful and cautious about touching, and <br>
  you got so distracted you forgot?” He shook his head. “I don't think so, something big happened.”<br>
  I swallowed before I answered, “I saw-” Was I really going to tell him?<br>
  “I'll tell you something else,” Ro began, speaking slowly and looking down at his hands looped in <br>
  his jean pockets. “Maybe on my way to class, I hear a Lord and Lady Cleric talking about a problem <br>
  with a demon Outside this morning.<br>
  Maybe I hear them talking about a Disciple who broke Doctrine and went beyond the Wall. They say a <br>
  Disciple disobeyed and even struck out, gave the Lady Cleric a black eye.” He looked up at me and <br>
  lowered his voice an octave. “You need to be careful now, you feel me? Think about the questions <br>
  you ask in</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="282" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">class and the way you react to some words. Likefairy, eh?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="283" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“What are you getting at?” I tried to pretend the shrillness of my voice was natural.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="284" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I couldn't tell them what had happened, if the Clerics were looking for me there was only a matter <br>
  of time before they found me. I was bound to slip up again. I had a bloody vampire snoozing in my <br>
  wardrobe for gods sake. I had decided the best was to play this was to not confirm or deny anything <br>
  else. Ro would try to help me and his heart would be in the right place, but I couldn't risk it.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="285" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">As for Alex “You do remember the Rupture? What happened to people like you who wouldn't get in line <br>
  and act right,” she said angrily.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="286" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">She was not happy and I could sense a long, rambling speech coming on. With all the information I'd <br>
  told her and Ro's speculations, she would have been able to piece together quite a bit by now.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="287" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Opening my mouth to tell her to shut the hell up, I saw Tu enter the room talking to a thin woman. <br>
  She was dressed in a crimson blazer with a swollen eye and bandaged arm. A Lady Cleric, the Lady <br>
  Cleric from that morning.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="288" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <h2 id="chp4" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Chapter Four</h2>
  <p class = "para1" id="289" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  I straightened and ordered my feet to freeze mid step back. My heart pounded double time as every <br>
  instinct I had screeched at me to run and hide. They really were looking for me, and knew the one <br>
  they sought was a Disciple. The Lady Cleric's gaze slowly passed over every female face in the <br>
  group as she replied to Cleric Tu. My stomach clenched and sweat beaded my brow. Did her gaze <br>
  linger on me? Did she hesitate to move on, or was it my imagination?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="290" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I wanted to scream at her that it was an accident. That I had no idea what all the crazy stuff <br>
  happening around me meant, nor did I want to. I wanted to rewind a day, back to when things were <br>
  simple. Where my life made sense and where boys spoke and acted normally. Where Clerics were the <br>
  good guys who protected us from demons and my teachers were not heartless murderers.<br>
  The Lady Cleric scanned our faces once more than shook her head once. She left with Tu close behind <br>
  her, whispering something to him.<br>
  What did I do? Surely if they had identified the Disciple in the forest was me, they would have <br>
  hauled me out the class.<br>
  Alex glanced over her shoulder at the retreating Cleric, but was otherwise uninterested. Ro was <br>
  more on ball, and his eyes narrowed as he watched me. Too messed in the head to try and be subtle, <br>
  I glared at him, daring him to comment. Well, there was nothing I could do. I'd had enough of being <br>
  stressed out.<br>
  Slouching back into my chair, I kicked up a leg on the empty seat opposite and mud fell off my <br>
  soles.<br>
  “Are you even listening to me?” Alex asked.<br>
  “I'm sorry, what? Oh, yes,” I said. “Yes, I do remember.”<br>
  The Rupture was a global slaughter that had nearly wiped the entire human race of the face of the <br>
  planet. It had changed everything. Vampires had emerged from the shadows one winter dragging all <br>
  manner of wicked with them, and in one clean sweep had consumed the earth. Shapeshifters had <br>
  prowled the streets in daylight. Hunting were-bears, were-lions and were-whatever-the-hell-you-can- <br>
  think-of had feasted on human flesh. Goblins tore people limb from limb and</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="291" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="292" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">roasted them in dumpster-sized stew pots. Raped the screaming women, and produced more deformed <br>
  offspring. Powerful witches cast spells that stopped the hearts of entire cities, made all things <br>
  in a thousand-mile radius just stop.<br>
  Within weeks governments had fallen. Monarchy's had been eliminated, a warped genocide, madness. No <br>
  one but the crazies who had believed in such things was prepared. They knew how to protect <br>
  themselves with stakes and silver, hiding places underground. Otherwise only the strong, quick and <br>
  the smart had survived. The barbaric culling of the human race left us scattered across the world <br>
  in tiny pockets of civilization. Communities of people who put aside old hates based on colour and <br>
  religion, and blended together until the human race was a convergence unlike anything ever <br>
  predicted. We lived in an overcrowded region of land surrounded by electricity, a patch of city <br>
  untouched by the horror Outside.<br>
  At least, that's what the Priests told us in their sermons. Most people alive now- a-days were too <br>
  young to remember what had happened, and the old ones who had experienced it had died of old age <br>
  years before. Against all odds endangered humankind had survived and had the Sect to thank. A group <br>
  of human men and women had erected the Wall, and set the strongest of us as guardians.<br>
  Determined to keep fighting and to survive at all costs, they selected new protectors from the <br>
  masses seeking sanctuary and trained them to hunt the monsters that had stolen the planet. Those <br>
  protectors were the Clerics. They hunted down any demon that dared step on our territory. Of course <br>
  I remembered the Rupture; it was something I, nor any other being, would ever forget.<br>
  Clicking her fingers in front of my face, Alex flicked my nose and I recoiled. She smirked, happy <br>
  to have broken into my down time. “You wanna end up like the people who lost their lives for <br>
  nothing?”<br>
  “Wouldn't call marching up to the closest demon and trying to kill it, nothing,” I said. Chewing my <br>
  bottom lip, I cautioned myself to be careful. “I ran that's all. I just ran.”<br>
  “Thinking on it, I don't believe you,” Ro said. I shrugged. I couldn't tell them, it was too big.<br>
  Alex placed her palms on the table. My eyes darted from hers to the small runes that decorated the <br>
  back of her hands. “The Wall keeps us safe. It keeps those</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="293" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="294" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">demons out and us humans in. That's the way it be, Rae. If a vampire or goblin were to lay hands on <br>
  you-” She shuddered, her eyes becoming hollow with visions of death and gore from years past. “Your <br>
  life here means something.<br>
  Don't throw it away.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="295" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“The Rupture happened lifetime's ago. Who knows what it's like out there?” I leaned forward and <br>
  lowered my voice to match hers. “They may have changed, evolved.” I thought of Breandan and Tomas. <br>
  “Y'know, I don't think he Sect have been honest about what they're like.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="296" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Evolved? Demons be animals, dangerous animals driven by need, nothing more.” She took a deep <br>
  breath. “The Doctrine of the Sect is law. Clerics keep the law, and Doctrine says going beyond the <br>
  Wall is forbidden. The rules keep us safe.” She visibly relaxed as she said the words.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="297" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Familiar frustration bubbled inside me at her lack of curiosity. “What if that's not how it's <br>
  supposed to-Forget it,” I said and ducked my head. I felt her eyes on my face and I carefully kept <br>
  it blank, my gaze cast down to the floor.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="298" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I couldn't force her to change her mind in a minute, nor did I want to. She was the one making <br>
  sense and thinking clearly. I was the one making waves, and allowing dangerous beings to run riot <br>
  unchecked and unopposed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="299" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A voice said close to my ear, “Am I to keep the vampire in your wardrobe a secret?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="300" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I jerked up and Devlin leaned back, grinning impishly. I swear, if I had not spent a lifetime <br>
  controlling my face and emotions, I probably would have launched myself at him shrieking. Ro had <br>
  wandered off across the room, and I hadn't seen Devlin sidle up, too lost in my thoughts. How the <br>
  hell did he find out? He must have seen Tomas carrying me across the Temple, but Tomas was sure we <br>
  would be moving to fast to be seen. Panicked, I opened my mouth, but nothing came out. I didn't <br>
  know what to say. Oh Gods. Devlin gazed at me, green eyes clear and sharp. I decided the best plan <br>
  was to deny it. To call him deluded or whatever I had to get him off my back. It was his word <br>
  against mine, and though I was considered freaky, the mere suggestion I had a vampire in a wardrobe <br>
  was just crazy. But then hadn't my behavior had been somewhat suspect? I glanced around. Devlin <br>
  coming over to talk to me captured the attention of the entire class, but no one seemed overly <br>
  alarmed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="301" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="302" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“What?” I said in a perfection imitation of cluelessness, but I knew my face was white as snow and <br>
  my voice brittle.<br>
  “Don't worry, I won't tell anybody. What fun would that be?”<br>
  He was still leaning close over me, speaking right into my ear so no one else could here. To the <br>
  casual observer it may have looked like he whispered sweet nothings in my ear. My heart sunk. What <br>
  did he have in mind? Blackmail?<br>
  “Why are you doing this?” I asked in a low voice. “Just go away.”<br>
  I sank further into my seat and turned my head away slightly, clearly giving the message I didn't <br>
  want to talk anymore. Childish tactics, but confrontation didn't seem to work, maybe ignoring him <br>
  would. He had that amused smirk that made his face look smug and I found myself detesting his <br>
  presence. There was something decidedly off about him, and the perfection of his face was making me <br>
  sick.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="303" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He turned to Alex, narrowed his eyes and moved his lips without sound. Maybe if I acted bored of <br>
  this theatrics he would get the message and leave. I watched him with cool detachment.<br>
  He spoke to me whilst keeping his gaze on her, “This is a female of strength. You choose your <br>
  friends well.” His fingers, seemingly infused with light, brushed her check.<br>
  I didn't like that and I smacked his had away. Alex started, as if coming to from a trance and sent <br>
  me a baffled look.<br>
  “Who's the boy outside?” Ro said from across the class.<br>
  I shot up. Devlin backed away a pace, as if I was suddenly too close for comfort. I excused myself <br>
  and walked speedily to Ro's side, all the while telling myself the fairy-boy I'd met that morning <br>
  would never dare. He would know he could not show up here at Temple, and parade around half naked, <br>
  and glowing. I reached the window and made a strangled noise. Breandan. At least he'd had the good <br>
  sense to glamour himself human. His eyes flicked from me to behind me, and then he beckoned to me.<br>
  “Rae, you know him?” Ro asked and eyed me head to toe. A slow smile spread</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="304" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="305" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">across his face, and the green beads he'd tied into the end of his cornrow plaits clicked together <br>
  as he laughed. “You be keeping secrets, eh?”<br>
  “Yes,” I said, took a step backwards. “I mean I don't know” In truth I was not surprised Breandan <br>
  was there. I just wondered how long he intended to follow me and if his ultimate goal was to have <br>
  me strung up Outside by the Clerics.<br>
  Breandan waved at me, impatient this time.<br>
  “He seems to know you.” Ro ran his tongue over his top teeth. “If you don't want him, I'll take <br>
  him.”<br>
  Breandan stood on the grass with his hands loose by his sides and somehow, through the rain, I saw <br>
  the storm in his eyes threatening to drown me. He didn't beckon to me again, but I knew he wanted <br>
  me to go to him. Afraid of the hot, fluttery feeling spreading through my limbs, I shook my head <br>
  hoping he got the message. This was not okay. He could not come here and expect me to run off with <br>
  him into the forest like a lunatic.<br>
  His head drooped then snapped up, his gaze directed over my shoulder. “Rae, you right?” Alex asked <br>
  from beside me. “What's going on?” Then she<br>
  spotted Breandan scowling at me. “That's him? The boy from this morning?”<br>
  A few other Disciples got up out their desks and came over to look out the window at whatever it <br>
  was we were looking at. I took a few steps back until I bumped into someone standing behind me. <br>
  Devlin stood in my way and looked furious. What was his problem? He was the one on my back, not the <br>
  other way round. Then his shoulders started to shake and I realized he was laughing. He looked <br>
  straight at me and smiled. No. Not a smile, but a snigger filled with wicked delight. The intensity <br>
  of his stare boldly probed mine, and the chill that slithered down my spine had me wound to near <br>
  breaking.<br>
  When I looked back round Breandan's entire body tensed, and just like that, with one last glance at <br>
  me he turned and darted away. A sense of relief was replaced by a fiercer surge of regret. The <br>
  moment he winked out of sight the longing to see and feel him, pressed upon my consciousness. The <br>
  emotion was like a splinter burrowed beneath the skin, determined to settle in for the long haul.<br>
  I thought then about telling a Cleric, Breandan, a demon from beyond the Wall,</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="306" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="307" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">could get onto the Temple grounds. Why was I was covering for some boy I barely knew? Yes, he'd <br>
  told me I was a demon, but what if that had been a lie. I looked pretty damn human to my eyes. Yes, <br>
  I'd done some demon stuff, but I could be a witch. The thought made me very nervous. All witches <br>
  were bad, forces of evil. Did I really want to wish to be one? My mind wandered back to Breandan, <br>
  the boy who made me warm and tingly when I thought about him.<br>
  And that is why I resolved to keep my mouth firmly shut. That and the fact I was hiding one of the <br>
  scariest of demonkind in my wardrobe.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="308" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Ro stared out the window, confused. Unlike me, he was not used to the fairy disappearing act, and I <br>
  could see him trying to figure out how Breandan had left so quickly. The other Disciples had lost <br>
  interest and had wandered into small groups again.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="309" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It was all getting a bit much for me, and I couldn't keep up. My head felt light, spongy, and my <br>
  limbs weak. I was hiding so many things from so many people my brain felt like it was being pried <br>
  apart. Alex seemed to sense my stress since she dragged me out the door by my sleeve the moment the <br>
  bell rang.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="310" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“C’mon,” she said. “We got Alchemy and I don't want to be late.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="311" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Stumbling out the door, I waved goodbye to Ro. “But, I thought you were ditching,” I said, trying <br>
  to keep up mentally.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="312" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I need to keep my eye on you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="313" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Skipping out the room, I watched the back of her bobbing head. Breathing in I focused on her drama <br>
  instead of mine. “You like Ro, a lot,” I said.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="314" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Pushing out the side door to take a shortcut through the courtyard in the middle of the building, <br>
  we carefully trudged down the slippery pathway and she shot me evil eye. Pulling up our blazer <br>
  collars, we raced across and the rain pelted hard against my skin. My feet splashed in every puddle <br>
  along the way and the wind tugged on my body. Storms never bothered me. The power and beauty of the <br>
  sky churning, clouds darkened with rain and flashes of lighting made my skin goosy. We made it <br>
  through the heavy doors, and I rung out my hair and clothes as best I could, wiping my dripping <br>
  face on my wet sleeve.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="315" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I don't do steadies,” Alex said. She strutted off and I trailed behind, smiling into my shoulder.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="316" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="317" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Ro would be the perfect steady for Alex. He would take care of her, and love her for more than her <br>
  beauty. She knew this, and though she kept going on and on about his fondness for guys when he <br>
  wasn't with her, that's what the real problem was. He saw through the cocky smiles, the extrovert <br>
  character to what she was about.<br>
  Marriage was an old and tired concept. The last union performed around a century before, about the <br>
  time the last of the old religions died out. But if it were practiced they definitely would be <br>
  suitable candidates in my mind. People didn't tie themselves to each other anymore. Why should <br>
  they? Chances were you'd find somebody who appealed more in a few years. People knew it was best to <br>
  keep it simple. There were romantics, of course, who feel in love and ran away to other regions to <br>
  start new lives. Two Disciples had tried that idea three years ago, and had tried to travel to the <br>
  next region by going Outside. The Clerics had us Disciples visit their graves once a year as a <br>
  reminder of what happens to the stupid and irresponsible.<br>
  “Lex, I can't,” I said and stopped walking.<br>
  She spun round and frowned. “Can't do what?” Her face smoothed. “Rae, if we don't turn up to <br>
  class-”<br>
  “I know,” I cut in and backed away. “You go on. I'm going to go sit in the Library for a while. <br>
  Cover for me? Say I have a headache and went for some quiet time. I'll deal with the punishment.” I <br>
  didn't wait for her answer, and took off at a run back down the hallway.<br>
  Walking into the Library, I gave myself a mental pat. It was empty and blessedly quiet. The <br>
  library was just a bunch of bookcases pushed against the wall and a few tables and benches arranged <br>
  in the centre. It smelt musty, but not unpleasant, as if it had been a while since the air was last <br>
  disturbed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="318" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I settled down on a table with a low lamp and closed my eyes, enjoying the stillness. Here I could <br>
  be at peace. I drummed my fingers on the tabletop. Then I ran them through my hair and frowned when <br>
  I encountered tangles. I redid my makeshift hair bun, trembling a little when I fingered the twig <br>
  and remembered what had happened after I had found it. I scrunched up my face then relaxed it <br>
  again. Scrunch and relax. Urgh, but my mind was not quiet. It was shrieking at me, throwing back <br>
  everything from that morning. Closing my eyes did not</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="319" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="320" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">change the fact I had a vampire in my wardrobe that was going to reanimate in a few hours. My mind <br>
  lingered on thoughts of Tomas's dark, bottomless eyes and the fact Devlin somehow knew he was in my <br>
  wardrobe. How did he know? How, how, how? Breathing in deeply did not fix whatever genetic quirk <br>
  made me a demon. Oh gods, how could I be a demon? Shouldn't I have figured that out by myself? Why <br>
  did someone have to point out such obvious things for me to finally add it all together to equal <br>
  demon? As my thoughts touched on Breandan, my body went haywire. My heart sounded to pound and my <br>
  hands became slick with sweat. Where was he? Would I see him again? In the space of one morning my <br>
  whole life had been turned upside down, yet the thought of never seeing or touching him again <br>
  wasunbearable.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="321" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I got irritated with myself. I'd come to the Library for a quiet place to think and figure out what <br>
  I was going to do, not moan about what had already happened. I needed a plan of action. I needed to <br>
  remain calm, and collected, and work this thing out. I tried to get comfortable on the hard wooden <br>
  seat, but the feeling of discomfort that had appeared when Breandan left had lingered, and in the <br>
  last few minutes had changed slightly. The splinter wasn't burrowing under my skin anymore, but had <br>
  almost, insistent. Like, ‘look here I am’.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="322" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The door opened. Sounds and smells of the world rushed in, breaking my reflective bubble. I jerked <br>
  up. In a lifetime of habit, I shied inward and prepared myself to become part of the furniture.<br>
  A boy, blazer collar turned up sauntered into the room. White hair flopped down to conceal one of <br>
  his sparkling eyes. The gods be damned, it was Devlin. Rather than launching into a tirade of <br>
  accusations like I expected, he said nothing. He simply stared at me like I was the most <br>
  fascinating thing he'd ever seen. It made me feel like a butterfly, entangled in a web of lies, and <br>
  waiting for the spider to pounce.<br>
  The solid silence was driving me mad. “Hai, Devlin.” My voice was strained. “You don't like me very <br>
  much,” he said.<br>
  A few responses played on my lips before I chose, “Direct.”<br>
  “That boy we saw outside Demon Theory, how long have you known him?” I looked away, stayed silent. <br>
  “It was a simple question.” He paused. “Boys from the slums can be dangerous.” His voice held an <br>
  undercurrent of humor that I</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="323" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="324" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">didn't like. It was like he knew Breandan was not from the slums. Like he knew he was<br>
  I looked down at my shoes. “I'm not talking about this.” “May I ask why?”<br>
  There was that odd speech pattern again. There were so many different dialects mixed in with the <br>
  broken slum speak, that it was difficult to determine someone's roots just by how they spoke <br>
  unless they told you. I knew next to nothing about Devlin, but his manner of speaking was familiar <br>
  to me. Where had I heard it before?<br>
  “Not your business,” I replied succinctly.<br>
  His face darkened, as if he had guessed the direction of my thoughts.<br>
  “What do you want, Devlin? Making good on a bet to embarrass the misfit?” My cheeks got hot. “Why <br>
  do you keep trying to be friends with me and how did you know about-” I shut up. I was meant to be <br>
  pretending I didn't know what he was talking about when he said I had a vampire in my wardrobe. <br>
  Scrunching my brows, I shook my head. “I don't know you, and you're questioning me? Being a fellow <br>
  Disciple does not give you a hold over me. Despite what you think I can talk to whoever I like. <br>
  It's my business and I'm dealing, so stay out of it.”<br>
  His eyes lit with a shocking fierceness and I jerked back. His constant intensity was <br>
  disconcerting, but he seemed to know nothing else to be a threat to me.<br>
  Clearly, he'd managed to catch a glimpse of Tomas, put the pale skin, fast movement together and <br>
  figured, vampire. But to prove it he would first have to get someone to listen and believe him so <br>
  that he could be allowed into the Bayou, the girl's dorms, to show them. Would he risk his <br>
  reputation on a whim like that? I was panicking for no reason. He had nothing. I managed a polite <br>
  smile. I stood up and marched past him.<br>
  “Well, I'll see you around.” He grabbed my arm and I lashed out with a hard shove. “Why can't you <br>
  back off?”<br>
  He staggered back and lowered his brows at my rudeness. I pushed him so hard his blazer flapped <br>
  back off his shoulder and I saw a flash of green and gold swinging from his neck, resting on his <br>
  chest above his heart. He had a pendant</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="325" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="326" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">like mine. It explained why he was so interested in the one I wore. His was different though, <br>
  bigger and darker in colour. Huh, despite his interesting taste in jewellery, I was still pissed at <br>
  him. I was raw and not fit for any other surprises. A girl can only handle so much crazy. I'd told <br>
  him to leave me alone, but he didn't seem to take subtle and even blatant hints. It was time to be <br>
  rude. My shaking hand pushed the hair from my eyes so I could glare properly.<br>
  “Why do you keep popping up? Everywhere I go there you are.” As I said the words I realized how <br>
  true they were. He was always nearby, lurking somewhere. I'd never seen it before then.<br>
  “So what if I am following you?”<br>
  I scowled. He wasn't even going to try and deny it. “If you are then stop.” “Of course, but I want <br>
  you to give me something first.”<br>
  The door swept open again. My heart skipped a whole two thumps then pumped at double time. Because <br>
  Breandan stepped into the room, his bare feet silent on the stone floor. He let the door of the <br>
  library close with a dull click, and his gaze flicked between us. If I could have picked one person <br>
  to never join the conversation I was having with Devlin, Breandan would be that person. Clearly <br>
  the universe was out to get me.<br>
  Irritation twisted Devlin's expression before it settled into overly pleasing handsome lines. His <br>
  lips twitched and his attention locked solely on me.<br>
  My head swung from one to the other unsure of where to focus. As if one stupidly good-looking boy <br>
  wasn't hard enough to deal with, I now had two messing with my mind. I sat down heavily on the <br>
  nearest bench I could find and put my head in my hands. I was beginning to think it possible for <br>
  your head to explode from stress.<br>
  Breandan straddled the bench and settled close by me. He sighed. “You can't help but find trouble,” <br>
  he said.<br>
  My rude response caught in my throat. I stared at his guarded face and wanted to scream at him. I <br>
  wanted to demand to know what he was doing exposing himself and me like this, and tell him to get <br>
  lost.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="327" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="328" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">All I whispered was, “You shouldn't be here.”<br>
  Something shifted in his expression, and told me he knew how much I was freaking out, since he <br>
  smiled.<br>
  He touched my cheek. “We are safe.” “Am I interrupting?” Devlin asked icily.<br>
  His hands were fisted both sides of him, and his lips had a rigid set. Blazer hanging open, I <br>
  glimpsed his impressive physique as he turned his gaze to Breandan. Impressive but odd, he didn't <br>
  have any marks. All boys had marks. Not as many as Breandan, who had enough tattoos for three, but <br>
  Devlin's skin was completely pure.<br>
  “Rae, aren't you going to introduce us?” he asked and stared at Breandan.<br>
  Without looking at him, Breandan replied as he entwined his fingers with mine. “I'm no concern of <br>
  yours.”<br>
  Fingers firm and warm rubbed against mine. I was hyper aware of the touch. It reminded me of the <br>
  last time I had my hand in another's, in a vampires. That thought pulled me up short. The vampire <br>
  had touched me and I'd let him. Wow. I was seriously messed up. Years of being unable to interact <br>
  with others, and I let demons drape themselves all over me. I tugged my hand away but it was a <br>
  pitiful attempt. More for the sake of telling myself I had resisted, rather than actually wanting <br>
  him to let me go.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="329" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Interesting,” Devlin said. “I thought only Disciples, Clerics or Priests were allowed at Temple. <br>
  I'm new here, but I've never seen you before. When did you enroll?”<br>
  They peered at each other warily. Backs straightening and necks stiffening, they became silent.<br>
  A pressing need to defend Breandan had me stuttering, “It's no big, Devlin. He's my, uhguest.” I <br>
  shrank back as Devlin's glare turned on me. The last thing I needed would be for him to run and <br>
  spill Breandan was on Temple grounds. I did tug my hand away this time and fisted it on my lap. I <br>
  felt annoyingly bereft that he had released me. “I want him here,” I added in a rush.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="330" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="331" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan went still beside me, and I felt his focus shift to my face.<br>
  It grew cold. The lights flickered and ominous silence draped over me. A weird feeling crawled over <br>
  my skin, so I tensed. The lights blacked out. The room temperature hit rock bottom, and an icy gust <br>
  of air lapped at the back of my neck. I clutched Breandan's hand tight in mine again. Was it him <br>
  doing this? He needed to stop because he was making it a little too obvious that he didn't belong. <br>
  I squeezed the hand I held. The moisture in my eyes stung, and the pores on my skin shrank. Then <br>
  ‘it’ passed and the lights came back up. The air warmed.<br>
  “Power outage,” I said tactfully.<br>
  My mind was not able to deal with the concept of anything other than that. It was an easy lie. <br>
  Breandan snorted and rested an arm over my shoulder. He made soothing circles on my wrist. It was <br>
  nice, the lazy soft brushes against my skin.<br>
  “Rae,” Devlin said slickly, “Would you like to come with me? Somewhere private.” He smiled, nice <br>
  and slow. The kind of smile that suggested not much talking would be going on once he got me <br>
  alone. “We could get to know one another some more?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="332" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Confused at his sudden suggestive undertone, rejection was on the tip of my tongue. I had a vampire <br>
  to get back to, so my plan was to extract myself from this conversation as soon as I could and <br>
  leave. Who knew what Tomas would do if I was not there when he woke up. All of this had passed <br>
  through my mind in a split second then flew out as quick. Breandan's reaction to the invitation was <br>
  explosive. Snarling, he moved startlingly fast and blurred into a dark streak, a shadow.<br>
  Chests heaving and eyes blazing the boys faced off nose to nose.<br>
  I was confused and stared at the vacant spot the fairy-boy was moments ago. My reactions caught up <br>
  and I made a noise of alarm. I jumped up to push Breandan back a few paces, with difficulty since <br>
  he packed a truck-load more muscle and height than me. I tugged his chin down to look him in the <br>
  face. Tense seconds clicked by as I looked into the eyes of someone alien to me. Breandan glared at <br>
  me with traces of disgust and disbelief. I felt bad and annoyed because I wanted answers from him, <br>
  but I couldn't have him butting heads with other Disciples. If Devlin told a Cleric I'd let a <br>
  strange boy into Temple, I'd come under question.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="333" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  Hell, if Devlin threw in he knew I was hiding a vampire in my wardrobe, I would never see the light <br>
  of day again. They would probably lock me away for the rest of my life. Or kill me if they could <br>
  prove I was a demon and a threat.<br>
  “I think you should go,” I said wearily.<br>
  The horrible moment passed and Breandan's face gentled into exasperation and impatience. The shift <br>
  was so fast; I floundered, unable to account for the sudden change. Chuckling to himself, his arm <br>
  propelled me towards the door picking up my bag as we went.<br>
  “Walk me out,” he said cheerfully, he even had a spring in his step.<br>
  Wasn't I doing a dandy job of extracting myself from this situation? I was meant to be in my room <br>
  by now, waiting for my guest to wake up so I could answer his questions and get rid of him. <br>
  Instead, I was walking out a fairy that seemed happy to be in mortal peril, for that was the <br>
  situation for any demon on Temple grounds.<br>
  “You have my word no harm will ever come to you that will be of my making,” a voice said in my ear. <br>
  I turned to look Breandan in the eyes, sincere and warm. “I will always protect you. Even when you <br>
  don't me to,” he added after a small pause.<br>
  “I'm not afraid,” I said tartly and took a half step before drawing deep and taking another larger <br>
  one. I lowered my voice, “And I can take care of myself. By doing what you did back there you've <br>
  painted a big target on my back. I need to be careful after what happened this morning and you are <br>
  putting me in danger by just being here, and throwing your weight around. Devlin is a Disciple, a <br>
  popular one at that. He could get me into serious trouble. Besides, I think I'd be safer with him <br>
  than I ever would with you.”<br>
  He raised an eyebrow then became thoughtful.<br>
  As we left Sanctuary, cool air blew into my face and the speckles of ash that floated by were <br>
  comforting, familiar. It was tinged with smoke now the fires had been lit in preparation for the <br>
  night. The days were short so close to winter.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="334" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan moved ahead of me and took my hand. Before long I heard a group of Disciples nearby, their <br>
  high and happy voices floating through the dark coming</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="335" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="336" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">straight toward us. He turned so we no longer walked on the path to the main gate but out onto the <br>
  lawn surrounding the Temple, into the darkness. Over my shoulder I saw Devlin followed silently and <br>
  he didn't look alarmed but rather annoyed. Rather than an all-dark figure, I made out his angular <br>
  features and the green of his eyes. With a start I realized everything looked lighter, and then I <br>
  saw why. Breandan's tattooed skin glowed in the dark. It was like he wanted to get caught. Like he <br>
  really didn't care Devlin could name him as demon.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="337" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Said boy pushed between us, and grabbed my hand to pull me forward. My skin crawled. I tried to <br>
  pull away but he held on firmly. Breandan held on and stopped moving. I was stuck between the two <br>
  and Devlin was determined to keep going, so I squeaked when my arms nearly yanked out of their <br>
  sockets. Brendan growled, literally hunched his back and bared his teeth. The sound was a low <br>
  rumble, but resonated loud enough to be taken as a warning. Despite this display he had to let me <br>
  go to avoid hurting me, but he was not happy about it.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="338" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin barely broke stride as he half turned and smirked. Turning back to my puzzled face, he <br>
  feigned innocence. “Possessive isn't he?”<br>
  I looked over my shoulder and sent Breandan a wobbly smile. The reason known only to the <br>
  complicated workings of my heart, I wanted to reassure him that I was okay. Jaw working <br>
  soundlessly, he walked close behind us and kept his eyes locked on Devlin's long fingers wrapped <br>
  around mine.<br>
  Devlin let my hand go and I sighed in relief, we reached the Temple wall and I wondered what was <br>
  coming next. Breandan seemed quite unconcerned at how this was turning out, and I was curious to <br>
  see where this adventure was headed next. Seriously, where was it headed? There was no way through <br>
  the barrier here unless you could jump higher than twenty feet like a vampire, or scale smooth, <br>
  seamless concrete.<br>
  “Rae, place your hands over your eyes” Devlin said.<br>
  I planted my feet, ready to fight it out. Whatever these boys were planning would not go down as <br>
  easy as they thought. “I will not close my eyes. Do you think I'm that stupid?”<br>
  He blinked in shock; face dumbly surprised. It was like he'd never been told ‘no’ before.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="339" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="340" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The side of Breandan's mouth tugged up. “Please close your eyes,” he simplified.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="341" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan was asking me to do what Devlin wanted? Why? I looked between them. Something else was <br>
  going on in front of me, wasn't it? Thoughts swirled in front of my eyes. Devlin had joined the <br>
  Sect a month ago. The sightings of fairies at the Wall by the Temple had increased in the last <br>
  month. Breandan had been looking for me and the vampire a month. Devlin had not reacted to <br>
  Breandan's presence, or his strangeness with shock or fear. The fairy-boy had done some freaky <br>
  stuff, like strutting around bare foot, glowing and growling. These were not human traits. More <br>
  than this, Breandan had revealed himself to Devlin, even spoken to him.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="342" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You know each other,” I said, the challenge for denial clear in my voice. “Yes,” the boys replied.<br>
  I blew out a breath. “May I ask how?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="343" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Ye-”<br>
  “Not yet,” Breandan said.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="344" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">They were both on edge again. I had a feeling this was only remaining peaceful for my benefit.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="345" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I don't like not knowing what you're dragging me into. I don't think I'm so curious anymore.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="346" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I told you, you are safe.” Breandan seemed annoyed I had not trusted his word. “There are other <br>
  things you need to know and see,” he explained, “Before I can tell and show you everything.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="347" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“And right now you don't want me to see how you got in here,” I guessed. After a few moments of <br>
  stubborn silence, I shrugged and did as Breandan asked. “I don't see how this is going to-”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="348" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My eyes flew open and I gasped. Breandan's lips were pressed against mine. His eyes were open, <br>
  watching me. He leaned away a little and made a low humming noise.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="349" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="350" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“This would be easier if you trusted me,” he murmured. “I'll come back soon. Behave until then.” <br>
  He leaned back in, but paused. “And Rae, do not agree or give anything you don't want to.” His eyes <br>
  flicked to Devlin and his eyes narrowed into slits. His gaze darted back to mine. “Alright?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="351" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Confused, I nodded and closed my eyes as his lips met mine again. When I opened them again he was <br>
  gone. My first kiss, and it had made my toes curl in my boots and my heart swell. I swallowed <br>
  thickly and looked to the west. The sun had nearly set. My vampire-boy would rise soon.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="352" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin stared at me, considering. “I can almost see the questions tumbling around that head of <br>
  yours.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="353" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I'll even tell you a few. At best guess you're some kind of demon pet,” I said and paused <br>
  deliberately. “A human spy feeding the fairies information, I mean.” I didn't give him a chance to <br>
  answer. I started to walk away but then I spun around. “You haven't told anyone about the person <br>
  you saw me with this morning have you?” He said nothing for a long while and I looked up in alarm. <br>
  At the steady, appraising look he was giving me I felt a tide of stupid rising inside me, and I <br>
  stared to babble, “You're not double crossing demons are you? By working for the Sect and <br>
  pretending to be the demons inner eyes and ears, because that would be really dumb.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="354" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“As dumb as stashing a vampire in a wardrobe?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="355" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I swear my face must have turned the colour of snow again. Devlin rocked on his heels, sucked his <br>
  bottom lip into his mouth and chewed it thoughtfully. I caught the smile he tried to hide.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="356" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No,” he said finally. “I haven't told anyone. And you've got me all wrong.” His eyes became wicked <br>
  keen, fixed on my face. “You should stay away from him.<br>
  He could be dangerous.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="357" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“The vampire or the fairy?” I asked before slapping myself on the forehead. He laughed. It was a <br>
  delicate, carefree sound. “Both.”<br>
  My fingers curled into claws, and I squeezed them so tight my nails split skin, gouging out a chunk <br>
  of my palm. My blood trickled down my wrist before my whole hand burned and the skin repaired <br>
  itself, spreading over the cut. Healed, I</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="358" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="359" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">froze and slowly raised my gaze. Devlin didn't look shocked or scared. Simply amused. He quirked an <br>
  eyebrow and motioned with a sweep of his hand ‘lead the way’, it said.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="360" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I stared at him, waiting. He stared at me, waiting.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="361" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He broke first and did a good imitation of a long-suffering huff. I could see he was having a good <br>
  time at my expense.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="362" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Am I to keep what just happened a secret too?” “What just happened?” I said evenly.<br>
  I felt crazy confused. It was like there was this big, obvious thing dangling in front of my face <br>
  that I was too silly to see.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="363" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He stepped forward, and the stare he gave was so intense a tickle at the back of my brain made me <br>
  shudder. His encroachment on my personal space was uncomfortable.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="364" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I don't like people so close,” I told him and stepped away.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="365" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Boldly, he stepped forward again and reached for my hand. “Come with me,” he said softly and as an <br>
  afterthought half a beat later added, “Please?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="366" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A warning from my intuition fired in my head, and I yanked my hand away before he clasped it. “I <br>
  have to get back.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="367" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I looked over toward Bayou, conscious a demon was waiting for me, but couldn't help but stay still, <br>
  and keep trying to find that elusive obvious thing. There was something about Devlin I was missing. <br>
  I just knew it. Usually, if I didn't want to talk to someone I could ignore or drown them out, but <br>
  when Devlin asked me a question I felt I had to answer. When he spoke it was like I had to listen.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="368" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Breandan warned me away from you,” I said quietly. I backed up, wanting much, much more distance <br>
  between us and watched his face for signs of falsehood. “If you were a fairy informant, why would <br>
  he do that? Wouldn't he trust you?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="369" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="370" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I told you had me wrong, you came to that conclusion by yourself. Regardless, trust is a <br>
  complicated thing.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="371" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“He trusted you enough to leave me here, but not enough to warn me about you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="372" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I struggled to understand where my thoughts were headed. It felt like I was trying to lead myself <br>
  somewhere, but failing to use the clues I already knew to finish the riddle. Come on brain, do your <br>
  job and work.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="373" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Of course he would. The idea of competition for your affection will frighten him now. He's <br>
  terrified you may choose to go another way. The right way.” He gave me a quick fire grin, happy and <br>
  out of place. Now I thought about it, everything about him was out of place.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="374" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Tired of standing so still, and tense, I shifted and I stumbled over my own foot. I scowled at them <br>
  before remembering I had more pressing issues than my own clumsiness. My eyes darted to the dorm <br>
  and back to Devlin's face. His white- blonde hair did that weird shimmering thing and his eyes <br>
  sparkled, even in the dark.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="375" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It clicked.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="376" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No, no, no, you too,” I said, surprised and pointed at him. “You're a demon too.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="377" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He said nothing and that was more than answer enough for me. I reverted back to my original plan. I <br>
  turned and ran.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="378" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I didn't want to have to do this,” he called.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="379" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The next moment he was in front of me, sighing. I stopped before I slammed into him, my arms <br>
  flapping either side of me. My knees knocked together and I squeaked in alarm.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="380" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Oh gods. How could I have not seen this coming?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="381" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He moved, body blurring to close the distance between us. Crying out, I brought my hand up to ward <br>
  off an attack, but he halted, and pushed against my palm until all between our bodies touching was <br>
  my hand. The steady thump of his</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="382" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="383" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">heart pounded against me and the sweet scent of his body made me dizzy. Then I felt something cool <br>
  and hard pressed against my chest. There was a subtle vibration, a prickle of energy rolling <br>
  outwards. A tingle ran down my body and I wiggled. Looking down, I couldn't see anything, our <br>
  bodies were pressed too tightly together, but I was sure his pendant was pressed against mine <br>
  through the layers of our clothes.<br>
  “Don't worry, you're safe,” he said and cupped my cheek. The touch was not romantic, but somehow <br>
  authoritative and belittling. “You're coming home with me. Okay? Your real home.”<br>
  “No,” I said so quietly it was more a squeak. I raised my voice and it was strong this time, “No.”<br>
  The world spun and disappeared inch by inch the longer he was close, swallowed by the dark. He was <br>
  shorter than Breandan, and I stared into his eyes without craning my neck. Fixed in place by the <br>
  presence of him, the ability to move left me though the urge remained. I tried to focus on anything <br>
  apart from how close he was.<br>
  “Please,” I said. “Please move back. I can'tI can't think straight.”<br>
  Devlin's hand trailed across my face and caused a squirm. “I can see you're confused, frightened. I <br>
  can make it all go away.” His hand moved down my neck and across my collarbone. His finger hooked <br>
  around the leather tie that held my pendant, and pulled it up so it slipped out from under the neck <br>
  of my tee, and swung between our faces. There was a wicked gleam in his eye. “All you have to do, <br>
  to make it all go away is come with me. Or, give me your necklace.”<br>
  “I've had it my whole life,” I said and catching his hand I yanked the tie away from him. I sucked <br>
  in a shaky breath. “I told you what it means to me. You can't have it.”<br>
  “Don't you want everything to go back to normal?” His smile made the world dim and him bright.<br>
  I ran my eyes over him again, because he was too bright. There was something glowing and pulsing <br>
  around him. I tried to move away and as I did he took hold of my head in both of his hands. They <br>
  were overly warm and almost feminine, delicate. His eyes locked mine down and I stilled. Something <br>
  pressed on my</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="384" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="385" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">mind, tethered inside me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="386" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Clasping a hand round my neck he tugged. “Give it to me,” he commanded.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="387" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I was sweating. Was I being foolish? If I gave him my necklace he said everything would go back to <br>
  normal. I whimpered. I didn't want to give it to him. It was the most important thing I owned. The <br>
  only thing I had that was of any value, it was important to me. The necklace was my only connection <br>
   I had to a family that had given me up at birth, and was my reminder to be strong and independent. <br>
  A wrinkle of cold rolled over my skin and I shifted back, brought to by this out of place feeling. <br>
  I hesitated and leaned back further, a question in my eyes. He had been doing something to me, <br>
  making me forget myself.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="388" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Pushing him away, I shook with fear and anger. “What did you do to me?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="389" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Calm down, Rae.” He was distracted, looking around him cautiously. Then he spun and cursed, <br>
  peering at nothing. He seemed to see something I could not, for a wicked smile stretched his lips. <br>
  “Fool,” he sneered. “Come. Let me mark your face again.”</p>

  A streak of silver light flashed past and knocked me off balance. I stumbled, blinked, and Devlin <br>
  was gone. Standing alone in on the grass where he was I clucked around. Looking up, down, left and <br>
  right before understanding he was gone. I was seriously considering getting my eyes checked. I <br>
  freaked out in a big way; I had no doubt in my mind that Devlin was not who he said he was, And <br>
  that he was up to something, a ‘no good’ something. I didn't know what to do.<br>
  Oh gods, what was I doing? I needed a sign I was going to be okay, and that I was making the right <br>
  choices. Tomas would have risen by now and would be waiting for me. And here I was looking for a <br>
  Disciple, who was not really a Disciple, who knew about said vampire in wardrobe, and knew I knew a <br>
  fairy.<br>
  “There you are, Rae.” “Gah!”<br>
  I jumped and landed at such an odd angle my right foot jack-knifed out painfully, and I fell. How <br>
  many times was I going to land on my ass today? It was a damn good thing I didn't bruise easy.<br>
  A hand appeared in my line of sight. Unsure of what to do, I studied it intently before slowly <br>
  lifting my head to look at the boy offering it to me.<br>
  Long ebony hair pulled into a ponytail, his ears were pointed at the tips and his gold eyes glowed. <br>
  I had never seen anyone other than myself with such light hazel eyes before. His were striking and <br>
  almond shaped, like mine. His face was all hard angles, smooth expanses of skin, and incredibly <br>
  beautiful. Chest bare, his lower body was encased in leather plates intricately engraved with <br>
  leaves. A sword, the length of my torso and latched to his back, triggered a shudder.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="392" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You have nothing to fear from me.” The fairies voice was warm, friendly. “My name is Conall. <br>
  Breandan sent me.”<br>
  Conall, I remembered the name. Breandan had said it before, I was sure of it. The fairy didn't make <br>
  any other move and he seemed friendly, so I swallowed the yell I'd had ready. With my eyes darting <br>
  from the hand to his face, I clasped it. He yanked me up with more force than necessary, and <br>
  stumbling over my own</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="393" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="394" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">foot, I crashed into his chest. I flushed as he clamped a hand around my shoulders, set me away <br>
  from him, and held on until my legs steadied.<br>
  “You guys think it's okay to just pop up out of thin air. It might be normal where you come from, <br>
  but I'm used to seeing people coming a good few seconds before they're there.” Placing a hand on my <br>
  hip, I clutched the other over my poor, poor heart that may give out any day. “You scared me, do <br>
  you understand? I don't like it.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="395" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He bowed, arm coming across his torso to rest upon his chest. He moved with effortless grace and <br>
  predatory bearing. A demon. He smiled at me. “It won't happen again. Do not be alarmed, but I sense <br>
  something, odd.” His hands seemed to feel something out in the air in front of me, pushing at it <br>
  thoughtfully. A crease appeared above his brows in the middle of his forehead. “Its power pulls at <br>
  my nature then resists contact.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="396" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It seemed wise to keep quiet. Maybe I also should have told him I didn't like ambiguous statements.<br>
  I filed the phrase away for later and instead took my cue from Conall. His face became grave, so my <br>
  face became grave. The fairies jumped from one emotion to the other so swiftly it was hard to keep <br>
  up naturally. I had decided to play monkey see, monkey do. He gazed at me silently for so long, I <br>
  became uncomfortable. I don't think I would ever master the blink-less stare these demons seemed to <br>
  be so good at.<br>
  “You seem stressed,” he said.<br>
  “Conall, I've had a hell of a day and you seem to be gearing up to let me in on big demon secrets, <br>
  but I've got to be honest with you, now is not a good time.”<br>
  I backed away. I was halfway back to Bayou and it was full dark. I didn't feel any danger from <br>
  Conall, but I was worried about what Tomas would do if he remained in my room much longer. What if <br>
  he got hungry? I had to get him out of the Temple as soon as I could. I didn't know what the hell <br>
  had happened to Devlin, but I was guessing the silver streak was Breandan. If Devlin got away from <br>
  him he might tell the Clerics I had a vampire in my wardrobe. I had stuff to do, and surely <br>
  whatever this fairy had to tell could wait a few hours.<br>
  “This cannot wait. Breandan would show you himself, but he thought it was</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="397" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="398" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">better in the long run if I am the one to show you. I must help you adjust to your true form and <br>
  help you with your first conjuring, or it could end badly.”<br>
  I frowned at him. Then I frowned over my shoulder where the silver streak had disappeared. “That <br>
  was Breandan then.”<br>
  He nodded. “You came close to being lost to us.” Pausing, his eyes flicked to me then swiveled <br>
  around the compound as the corners of his mouth pulled down. “You must be careful who you're alone <br>
  with.”<br>
  He walked off prompting me to follow. “Uh, where are we going?”<br>
  The fairy strolled along unconcerned but I glanced around, worried. There had been many strange <br>
  occurrences connected to me, and I was becoming more noticeable. For someone used to living under <br>
  the radar it was unsettling. I didn't want to draw any more attention to myself, but I couldn't <br>
  just let him wander around the Temple.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="399" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I really do have something important to do,” I added after a beat since he didn't answer. <br>
  “Breandan said he was going to come back, so I don't think it'd be too big of a deal just waiting <br>
  until later.”<br>
  “He's dealing with Devlin,” Conall said. “I'm to protect and guide you to the white witch and he'll <br>
  meet us as soon as he can.”<br>
  A pickle of fear seized me all over. “Witch?” I said sharply. “Witches are bad, and we are going to <br>
  go visit one?”<br>
  “She is someone who will help you to understand what is happening.”<br>
  “Huh. Why didn't Breandan send someone else after Devlin?” In my head I appended the sentence with, <br>
  like you.<br>
  He heard the unspoken and slid a sly look my way. “They both want something only you can give, and <br>
  you can only give it to one of them. Devlin is as cunning as Breandan is frank. He needed to deal <br>
  with it personally.”<br>
  “I'm not on the market, nor is anything I own.” I pressed a hand over my chest</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="400" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="401" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">were my pendant lay. Now Conall had given me the heads up I would not be letting it out of my <br>
  sight. Not that it had ever left my neck in the last eighteen years.<br>
  “Being difficult won't help you in the long run. Stop trying to reason as a human would. You are <br>
  not one and you're not built like one. Your body and mind can handle much more. Soon, you will <br>
  learn this. You will learn there are rules that must be observed and respected.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="402" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I ground my teeth together. “You're making assumptions. I have respect, and I just know, no matter <br>
  what anybody says I am not giving this necklace up.”<br>
  I had decided the moment I met him I'd be safe with him, but I was anxious of what was coming next. <br>
  Feeling foolish, I tapped him lightly on the shoulder. He looked a question at me and I waved him <br>
  closer. He leaned down from his lofty height to peer into my face quizzically. “I've figured out <br>
  you guys can jump really high, but I can't. I can't jump over the Temple wall.” Stepping away I <br>
  shrugged to show nonchalance, but reddened. At a moment like this Tomas would have come in handy. <br>
  He had jumped it in a single bound. “We can't go out the gate either. I don't even want to think <br>
  how I would explain you.”<br>
  He gave me a warm smile and I immediately felt at ease, grinning back. “Don't fret,” he said. <br>
  “It'll take time for you to learn what you can and cannot do.”<br>
  Without breaking stride he took my upper arm and jumped. We passed high over the wall then fell. <br>
  Conall's feet hit the ground and I was left dangling from the floor at an awkward angle. He <br>
  carefully set me down and continued walking. To my credit I didn't freak. I'd done the stunt <br>
  before, and I was practically a veteran.<br>
  The sun had begun to set and the sky was sapphire, contrasting beautifully with the green of the <br>
  treetops. We reached the Wall and Conall stopped, to stare hard at the buzzing wires, red hot with <br>
  electric current.<br>
  “You're doing what Breandan did last time? To the Wall, I mean.” Babbling beside him I straightened <br>
   my clothes. “You somehow stop the current without tripping the klaxon. I think I've done it <br>
  before, by accident.”<br>
  “Could you be quiet for a moment?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="403" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="404" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Another blush crept up my neck. “Okay, shutting up now.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="405" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“It's done. In answer to your question, yes.” Conall pointed to a small man sized hole now in the <br>
  Wall, moved through it and disappeared into the trees.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="406" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Biting my lip, I climbed through and stumbled after him. As we moved I entwined my hands in the <br>
  coarse grass swaying about my waist. Tugging a few clumps free of the earth, I ran my fingertips <br>
  over the petals of a wild flower that tickled my palm. The thrumming of crickets and rustle of life <br>
  in the undergrowth made me smile. The air, heavy with the scent of soil, felt alive as we basked.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="407" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall breathed in deeply. A satisfied smile danced on the edge of his mouth. “Do you know how drop <br>
  your glamour?”<br>
  “No.” I slid up my hood.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="408" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Standing legs apart, his hands came to rest on his narrow hips. “You understand the physical of <br>
  your nature?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="409" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I let the clumps of grass fall and wiped my hands on my jeans. “I'm fast. I heal.” “Have you <br>
  measured your strength?”<br>
  Disconcerted, I rubbed my nose. I hadn't thought of what being a fairy really entailed. I knew that <br>
  they were fierce and hard. They healed fast and were the most powerful of the demons. They had <br>
  strong characters and were beautiful. They had buckets of pride and protected what they thought was <br>
  theirs. They had magic. I was one of them. But what did it mean to be a fairy? Was there a pecking <br>
  order like there was within the Sect and who protected, and guided them? Did they really live as <br>
  nomads and in small families by choice? Or was it a result of the Rupture, like the Wall was.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="410" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I haven't thought about it. I haven't thought about much to be honest. Stuff keeps happening a tad <br>
  fast.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="411" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“If I was human,” he snorted, “and discovered I was much stronger, faster I would not be able to <br>
  stop myself.” He shrugged. “My nature is proud.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="412" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I thought on it for a while. “It's hard to believe all of this. You all seem so real.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="413" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="414" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall gave me an odd look. “Understand, in my world demons are odd not humans.”<br>
  “A complicated way of saying you're adjusting.”<br>
  I stuck my tongue out at him and placing my legs a foot apart, bent my knees like I was to do some <br>
  damage. Balling my hands into fists, I pushed thought to the back of my head to clear up some <br>
  thinking space.<br>
  “I'm ready. Let's do this.” The sooner I got this done, the sooner I could get back to Tomas.<br>
  “You know you're fast?” I bobbed my head. He grinned, a slash of white against the dark tan of his <br>
  skin. “When the spell broke how did you feel?”<br>
  There was that buzz word again. Spell. Breandan had mentioned a spell breaking and something being <br>
  painful. My heart picked up. Was this going to be painful? Is that the real reason why Breandan <br>
  wanted this fairy to show me instead of him? I realized Conall was waiting for my answer.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="415" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Uh” I thought back to running away from the Clerics, their dogs chasing me down; believing I was <br>
  about to be ripped to pieces by teeth. “Scared.”<br>
  His brows pulled together. “Scared? Not a strong emotion, and certainly not strong enough to break <br>
  a spell.”<br>
  “I was completely bricking myself.”<br>
  I watched as he translated that into something he could understand. “Better,” he concluded and <br>
  looked at me hard. “Before the speed what was your state of mind?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="416" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I hopped from one foot to the other. “Did you not hear me? I was terrified. I wanted nothing more <br>
  than to be far, far away from an ugly painful death.”<br>
  “Precisely. Your state of mind is crucial when conjuring. Glamour is no different.”<br>
  “Ah, no incantations over a cauldron bubbling with chicken feet and grave dirt?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="417" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="418" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I had a flash of myself doing a tribal dance in front of an open flame with mud on my face, an <br>
  animal fur slung about my naughty bits. and bones plaited into my hair. I muffled a snigger.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="419" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“If you are a witch laying a spell to hide than yes, but not fairy glamour. It is done with little <br>
  concentration. Eventually you'll conjure and drop your glamour with ease. When we glamour ourselves <br>
  we suppress our nature. This cloaks our ears and makes us less otherworldly by fixing our features <br>
  to one state. A safeguard is created around our being. Once sight passes through it makes us look <br>
  more human. We dislike when people are in our,” he pursed his lips, “the humans call it personal <br>
  space unless they have a close connection to us.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="420" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I struggled to understand. “So, the ears and the glowing still exist but we just can see it?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="421" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“The glamour disrupts what the mind perceives to be true. If you cannot see, smell, touch or hear a <br>
  thing why would you believe it is there?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="422" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I remembered the shield over Breandan, the pulsing around Devlin. “As fairies we can sense <br>
  glamour.” I said and nodded.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="423" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I had definitely gotten it wrong. Devlin wasn't human at all. He was a fairy, a fairy hiding in <br>
  plain sight at Temple. How he had managed such a thing was beyond me. To enroll you have to meet <br>
  the Priests and take a vow to uphold Sect Doctrine.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="424" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I think I'm there, but what do you mean about fixing ourselves in one state?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="425" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You notice how in fairy form we are severe one moment then jovial in another.” I tilted my head to <br>
  signal yes, and remembered Breandan's crazy mood swings. “This is because of the depth of our <br>
  temperament. Suppressing the fairy nature helps us blend. The drawback is you are slower, weaker. <br>
  Your senses are dampened as is control over magic. Our power comes from the Source of course, and <br>
  it is vast and limitless. It is energy. Energy lives in all things, constantly evolving and <br>
  blending into something new. Fairies have the strongest natural awareness of the forces surrounding <br>
  us and can draw from the Source, manipulate its power for our needs. The majority of us think of it <br>
  in broad strokes. It makes for easy focus and quick action.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="426" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Source?” I grinned like a loon. “You mean you're going to show me magic.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="427" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="428" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He nodded manically, feeding off my enthusiasm. “The most simplistic way to conjure is to seek the <br>
  power surrounding you, reach out to it and summon whilst channeling the energy. Watch me.”<br>
  A pinball of light appeared overhead, bloating to become a small ball of fire. It was the coolest <br>
  thing I'd ever seen, cooler than seeing purple in the dark or bouncing over walls. Suddenly it was <br>
  there, like it always had been my whole life. Like falling out a window as a child and not having a <br>
  scratch on you. Like dropping a full cup of water and it landing right-side-up without spilling a <br>
  drop. Like making a hole in the Wall without tripping the klaxon. My whole life the strange things <br>
  that happened around me had been attributed to freaky good luck since I couldn't be a witch. None <br>
  of it was under my voluntary control, and never did I really gain anything. But now it all lined up <br>
  in perfect order. The power was in my reach and mine for the taking.<br>
  Something pulsed close by, a mini sun of colour and heat that seemed to be nowhere and everywhere. <br>
  Instinctively I drew from its warmth. It was like turning the faucet of an unexpectedly <br>
  high-pressured tap. The flow of energy flooded into me, and spilled over the lip of who I was. To <br>
  save myself drowning or burning up I changed the feeling into a thing. Fire. A ball of flame <br>
  exploded into existence, hurtling toward us. I watched the self made instrument of my rapidly <br>
  advancing death in awe.<br>
  An urgent sound muttered from Conall cut over the oncoming hiss, and just before impact, the <br>
  fireball imploded. It left nothing but a ringing in my ears, white spots across my vision and <br>
  enough heat to singe a few strands of my hair.<br>
  Conall's ball of fire hovered mockingly above.<br>
  “That was not as good as I thought it'd be,” I said faintly.<br>
  Conall's pupils were huge with shock and his pointed ears twitched. His face was stark white. He <br>
  released the white-knuckled hold on my upper arms and eased himself away. He'd thrown himself at <br>
  me and lurched into an odd crouch when the fireball was coming our way, ready to drag me out the <br>
  way if needed.<br>
  “Why do you perceive a giant ball of death coming toward you as a good thing?”<br>
  I ignored him. “You call the energy to you then you make it into what you want in your head?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="429" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="430" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“In a basic way, yes.” His voice returned to normal and the repressed panic in his eyes ebbed away. <br>
  “You must give yourself time to focus on what you want to achieve.” The looked leveled my way was <br>
  laced with warning. “The greater the focus the more effective the spell. It comes packing a punch.”<br>
  “More of a punch than the fire ball?”<br>
  “Yes,” he said wary. “We will leave further conjuring to another time. Agreed?” I gave a thumb up. <br>
  “Anything else I should know?”<br>
  “Our bodies are conductors. We can control as much energy as our body can withstand to channel, <br>
  never more.”<br>
  “I can't get better?”<br>
  “You can become proficient so spells are more effective and you can access as much energy as <br>
  possible but in terms of measurable power, no.”<br>
  “How do you know when you're at the limit?”<br>
  “Trial and error.” His voice had gone flat and the warning his eyes told me in no uncertain terms <br>
  should he catch me being silly I'd be in major trouble.<br>
  “I'll be careful,” I promised.<br>
  The breeze, lightly scented with lavender and periwinkle, caressed my heated skin. I was distracted <br>
  by a random thought. I plucked at my sleeve behind my back, and decided to just throw it out there.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="431" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Conall, you're a boy.” I burrowed the toe of my boot into the undergrowth. “Am I nice looking? For <br>
  a fairy, I mean.”<br>
  “You are beautiful.”<br>
  “You have to say that because Breandan will hurt you if you upset me.”<br>
  “No,” he said softly. “I admit I take his wishes into consideration when I speak to you, but my <br>
  thoughts and opinions remain my own.” His eyes roamed my face.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="432" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="433" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You have never seen yourself without glamour. And I have.”<br>
  I searched his face. I had never been slightly curious about my past. I figured if my family had <br>
  been willing to give me up they weren't worth my time. My necklace was my only connection to them, <br>
  and it was the only connection I needed. At least, that was how I felt up until that morning. <br>
  Learning I was a demon had changed a few things. Maybe I needed to re think the whole ‘my family <br>
  suck and I hate them’ thing.<br>
  “You have?”<br>
  “When you were a baby.”<br>
  It took a while for me to be able to speak. “You knew me?” I asked. “I mean, you know me?”<br>
  His face had clouded, voice lowered. “Yes.”<br>
  “I get the feeling you don't want to talk about it.”<br>
  “Yes.”<br>
  “Okay then,” I said slowly. It would do no good to push him. Besides, I was in no hurry to find <br>
  out, and I was not sure if I was ready to hear what he might say. “Another time then. So, this <br>
  glamour thing, I need to focus on nothing but stripping it away, right?”<br>
  “The spell was broken the first time you tapped into your nature. I'm sure of this. Breandan told <br>
  me what happened this morning.” The uncomfortable moment had passed, and his lips curved. “I have <br>
  never heard of a fairy fainting before.”<br>
  I gaped at him in horror. “He did not tell you that. I did not faint. I did not!”<br>
  “Of course.” His voice was serious, but the smile was still there. “Remove your glamour.”<br>
  I just loved how he said it like I already knew how. No pressure or anything. Taking a deep breath <br>
  I cleared my mind. Emptying my head of the confusion over Devlin took moments and was easy. <br>
  Clearing out thoughts of Breandan was</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="434" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="435" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">hard. Memories of his hands on my body, lips on my skin were electrifying. The eyes that turned me <br>
  inside out, and the smiles that dazzled took considerably longer to purge. Confusingly, the <br>
  thoughts of my vampire-boy were also hard to shake. Tomas's face kept popping into view every time <br>
  I managed to get the thoughts of Breandan under some kind of control.<br>
  Achieving oneness I relaxed into a trance, and for time unknown I simply, was. As my consciousness <br>
  floated I noticed a pulsing deep within me. I strained to touch it. Each time I thought I had a <br>
  hold it slipped through my fingers. I tried again, and again, and began to feel sad; the pulsing <br>
  glow looked beautiful and special. I had drawn from the Source easy enough before, why was it <br>
  causing me trouble now? I reached and wished it in my palm, pleading meekly. Nothing. Oh for gods <br>
  sake! The glow zapped into me and overflowed from my body to spill my aura into the air. A feeling <br>
  of bliss trilled inside me as layers of the lie tore one by one. My true self clawed its way out.<br>
  A drowning woman breaching the surface, gasping for air, my nature broke free of containment and <br>
  ran riot through my body in a frenzied burst.<br>
  My first urge was to run to a presence far to the north. A siren song my entire being hummed with <br>
  wanting. So strong was the call, I teetered on my toes and forcibly pulled myself back to <br>
  straight. I became conscious to the why the presence felt familiar. Breandan. Unable to make it go <br>
  away, I ignored the need and focused on everything else.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="436" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I moved, and my skin stung as if a layer had been stripped with a knife. There was a heavy pressure <br>
  at the bottom of my spine, and something soft thumped hard at my back, pressing against my top. A <br>
  larger, burning pain gripped my shoulders in a vice until my back arched. Stifled, my back was <br>
  stifled. Stomach muscles clenching my whole body quivered under the pain centering between my <br>
  shoulder blades. The fabric of my top gave way and I surged forward at the force of the thrust from <br>
  behind me. The pain in my shoulders was gone, but the awareness of more was overwhelming. Craning <br>
  my head to look round my body followed until I was doing a crazy spin.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="437" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Wings,” I choked as the golden tips extended to flutter into my line of sight. I blinked at my own <br>
  voice, a resonating sound of chinking crystals. That was me talking?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="438" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="439" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall was beside me, holding me up. “Pull yourself together,” he said.<br>
  I held onto the sound of his voice, held on to his stern command. If he had molly-cuddled me, I'd <br>
  have curled into a ball and cried. His matter of fact outlook kept me grounded. I tried to block <br>
  out everything but that close to me. My body responded immediately and every sensation collapsed on <br>
  itself.<br>
  “Oh,” I gasped and took another steadying breath.<br>
  Conall took out a knife, grabbed my shoulder and with a swift jerk cut a hole in my jeans. Slipping <br>
  his fingertip through the hole, he pulled something through and springing free it thumped against <br>
  the back of my thigh. I spun, and tried to catch the thick length of skin protruding from the base <br>
  of my spine. Each extra vertebra was under my control right to the tip. I focused on the extra limb <br>
  and it curled to hover by my waist. I clasped it and gasped. It was warm, soft and I stared <br>
  dumbfounded at the hard, leaf like tip. It felt strong. The skin was the same colour as my flesh, <br>
  but as it tapered the colour got lighter. Looking down at my tail, I noticed my nails had <br>
  lengthened and thickened into talons. I bit my lip and sharp points of pain had me tasting my own <br>
  blood. I ran my tongue over my teeth, less like teeth now and more like fangs. My bottom lip <br>
  throbbed as it healed. Then I focused on the heavy weight behind me. The two limbs curved away from <br>
  my body and looked like the wings of a dragonfly. Blood pumped through the veins and goose bumps <br>
  appeared in the absence of sun. My wings twitched. How the wind feels through your hair, such it <br>
  felt as a gust passed over and under my wings. The instinct came to me and they twitched again. <br>
  They spread, out and out, until I saw the great length of them either side of me. They beat once, <br>
  slowly, then again and again. Tremendous power trilled through me and I leant my strength into the <br>
  limbs attached to my back. They beat once more and my heels lifted off the ground. Shocked, I <br>
  stopped and dropped back down to the floor panting from the exertion.<br>
  I couldn't smile or cry or whimper. And so I screamed.<br>
  Something stung my cheek and my scream cut off. Conall drew back his palm. but this time I caught <br>
  his hand and held it. “I didn't think it would be such a shock. Perhaps we should have done this <br>
  differently. Breandan will be furious.” Conall frowned. “I want my hand back?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="440" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  I let him go, and instead held my hand out in front of me, fisted. I felt my tail doing some odd <br>
  twisting thing and found to hard to keep my balance. Once I'd figured out how to hold it straight, <br>
  I felt invincible. My wings curled behind me to rest snugly against my back and I rolled my <br>
  shoulders. Flexing my toes in my boots, I wiggled my fingers as my tail curled round my legs. The <br>
  tip occasionally brushed the floor.<br>
  “You should know wings are not gifted to all our kind and are great honor. You cannot fly, but you <br>
  can glide. The tail will help with your speed and balance.” His head snapped to peer into the <br>
  forest. “Breandan is to the-”<br>
  “Northeast,” I offered with certainty. It was weird because like a lens focusing, I could sense <br>
  Breandan. I knew the direction he was in and how long it would take me to reach him. Taking a step <br>
  away from where he was, my body resisted and fought to go the other way.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="441" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The fairy clapped his hands together beaming. “We've got time. What shall we do?”<br>
  I felt amazing, like nothing could end me. Untouchable. I knew I was fast, I knew my senses kicked <br>
  ass. How strong was I now? I glanced at the trees.<br>
  “You asked if I had tested my strength”<br>
  Conall's hands flew to his hips as his head rolled back. Ponytail swinging wildly his laughter <br>
  boomed. “You are delightful. You may throw me.” His hand swept over the forest.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="442" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My jaw hit the floor. “I can't throw you.” I deliberately narrowed my eyes. “Are you yanking my <br>
  chain?”<br>
  “Such a pretty chain, but I'm not yanking it. Yes, you can throw me. I'll not be harmed.”<br>
  “Really not worrying about you.”<br>
  Squaring my shoulders I strutted over to him. I did ask for it. Placing my hands on his arms I <br>
  tested my internal body function calculator. Well hey, I felt pretty damn strong. I peeked at <br>
  Conall's face for courage and to check he wasn't making fun. He grinned down at me with all the <br>
  confidence in the world.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="443" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  Bending my knees, I gripped his arms tight and braced myself. Lift, twist and hurl. The action was <br>
  so quick I barely saw my arms move. Conall shot over the trees like a black comet, and was lost to <br>
  sight in seconds. Hands covering my mouth, I bounced on the spot in horror. My ears stretched back <br>
  then I took off. I ghosted through the trees at speed with no fear of harm, franticly burning <br>
  across the rugged terrain. Through the awning of leaves my eyes spotted him falling.<br>
  As I drew closer he gracefully straightened out, soaring back to the earth pencil straight before <br>
  curling his body into a summersault. In a move of power and grace his feet touched down on the <br>
  forest floor with an ear splitting boom.<br>
  The ground shook; air rippled out and tossed fallen leaves. Conall was crouched, one fist and knee <br>
  on the ground, in a dirt hole. The earth looked freshly tilled where it had been forced to make way <br>
  for him. He sprung up laughing, and dusted himself off.<br>
  I slammed to a stop beside him, and for a moment my body screamed at me to keep going. I was closer <br>
  to Breandan. If I kept running and I would be at his side. Focusing on the fairy in front of me, I <br>
  rushed to apologize.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="444" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I didn't realize.” Breathy with panic my tail thumped my shoulder repeatedly. “Forgive me. Are you <br>
  right?”<br>
  My hands Glittered around him and he caught one to kiss it.<br>
  “I am proud,” he said bowed over my hand. “You will be glorious. I'm not heavy, but it was a good <br>
  demonstration nonetheless. There has not been a female fairy with a talent in strength for such a <br>
  long time.” Conall sounded delighted. “But then you will be talented in most things.” He released <br>
  my hand and tapped me on the nose.<br>
  I blinked at the playful gesture. “It was easy, like throwing a ball. Gods, I'm wicked strong.”<br>
  “I wait bated to see your castings.”<br>
  My face crumpled. Magic was not something I suspected would come easily to me. “It'll be a while <br>
  before I can control calling on the Source, and getting it to do what I want rather than whatever <br>
  stray thought is passing through my mind.”<br>
  “Aptitude will come quickly or not at all, such is the way of it.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="445" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="446" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You said I'm strong for a female. Is there anything else I could try?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="447" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You're eager.” Conall shook a little dust off, an efficient brush of his shoulder with an eloquent <br>
  hand. “Every fairy is unique, and it will take time for you to learn your skills.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="448" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I'm curious, what skills do you have?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="449" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He walked off into the trees. “You ask many questions,” he said matter of fact and jumped over a <br>
  huge boulder roughly my height.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="450" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I eyed it, my healthy competitive nature goading me on. Sense caught up me and I walked around it. <br>
  Conall waited patiently on the other side, and once he was visible continued walking.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="451" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I realized we had been travelling for an awful long time and that the forest had changed. It was <br>
  sparser, and the trees swept down into a bowl shape with the land. The leaves had broadened and <br>
  become darker, just as the trunks had become thinner and lighter. As the day drew to a close my <br>
  eyes adjusted, and the world tinted to purple and blue again. My sensitive nose and ears picked up <br>
  lingering trails, the snuffling of smaller mammals.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="452" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My senses stretched and I honed onto something, different. The ‘being’ sensed me touch her mind and <br>
  nudged me away. She was of the two natured, a canine shifter of some kind. Startled, I scrambled <br>
  back into myself. It was a shock. I knew of course there would be other demons Outside, this was <br>
  their territory. But still, I was shocked. I sought the comfort of the familiar.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="453" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Breandan,” I murmured. I knew he was near but not in my line of sight or range of hearing.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="454" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Yes, he is close.” Conall was beside me. He'd stopped walking as I skipped on. “He'll meet us <br>
  here.” He motioned with his hand for me to continue walking.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="455" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I pushed a hand through my crazy hair and stepped forward. Entering the glade I saw a colossal <br>
  building. Grey stone with marble statues adorned each corner and flanking the entrance. The slated <br>
  roof was thatched, golden and half caved in.<br>
  Trees and flowers sprouted on the ground inside, this I saw through the large glassless windows.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="456" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="457" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Witch.” Conall called and pumped his hand cheerfully. “Hai, Rae?” a sunny voice called across the <br>
  clearing.<br>
  I gawped at the blonde, blue-eyed cherub standing in the building entrance. Her hair was plaited <br>
  into a messy braid, and she wore a plain blue tunic, and soft brown boots. She looked like an upper <br>
  dwell. She grinned at me like we were the best of friends, and waved me forward.<br>
  Skipping ahead, she yapped over her shoulder. “I'm Ana or the white witch if you want to be formal <br>
  about it.” She shot a sour look at Conall.<br>
  I followed after her, totally bewildered by her and my surroundings. The building was solemn, and <br>
  as I walked through the bold entrance pillars - fairy mouths open in silent scream - I wondered of <br>
  its significance.<br>
  “What is this place?” I asked.<br>
  “A church. An old and secret place,” Conall replied from behind me.<br>
  The plant life from outside spilled in through the windows, and ivy snaked its way up the walls, <br>
  clinging to the grey stone in wild patches. Rows and rows of large stone steps circled the room. <br>
  Seats? The building foundation was naturally steeped into the dirt, growing from the earth itself. <br>
  My feet stepped springy, damp moss and crunchy thick grass mixed with flowered weeds.<br>
  “I like your eyes,” she declared. “Your family always did have the most beautiful gold eyes.” The <br>
  witch-girl had an innocent, pixie like face and curly blonde hair. She waved her hands up and down <br>
  my body critically. “You're meeting me in your true form. That is a good omen. Sometimes you come <br>
  to me still disguised as human and what I have to say never goes down well.”<br>
  “As long as you don't tell me what to do,” I said and gazed at the buckled roof, “we'll get along <br>
  just fine.”<br>
  Ana smacked her forehead then clicked her fingers into points and nodded. “Sorry, I get confused <br>
  somewhat when I meet new people. It takes a while to fit them into the bigger picture. The Sight <br>
  gives me glimpses of possible futures, and you're radiating images like a beacon whacked up to max. <br>
  It'll be easier for me once I've done a proper reading on you. The roads of your future will be</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="458" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="459" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">clearer and we can-” She spaced out, her eyes flickered at something unseen. “Oooh, that is not <br>
  good. Tell your blonde friend not to go outside on her own in the dark. In most futures it ends <br>
  badly.”<br>
  “Huh?” I croaked feeling a million miles behind.<br>
  “I'm trying to get a feel for where we are time wise,” she enlightened. Her tiny palms flew up. <br>
  “Wait. Has that vampire bitten you yet? You should have met him by now.” She frowned and looked <br>
  inward. “I'm missing something.”<br>
  My heart thumped. She could only be talking about Tomas. I was hyper aware of Conall standing alert <br>
  beside me at the mention of a vampire. I twisted my hands into my jumper pockets. “Uh, I don't know <br>
  what you mean.”<br>
  “Maybe if you never meet him you won't end up at Orchard. That's a relief. I did a reading on <br>
  Breandan, and he ends up there in chains. He gets distracted because the vampire wants you.” She <br>
  frowned. “No wait, I think it's a humans fault. Damn, I can't see. Anyway, things get out of <br>
  control. You know how vampires are once they've had your blood. Bottom line is in this future you <br>
  all died. Sometimes you save him but not the vampire. Or you save the vampire and the human but not <br>
  Breandan. I can't see what the difference is between one future and the other. My advice is to <br>
  avoid Orchard if you can.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="460" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Say-so,” I said. Not that I'd ever had any plans to be in the company of Tomas for much longer or <br>
  ever visit this Orchard place. “Y'know what, I'm going to be honest and say I have no idea what to <br>
  do with anything you just said. I've seen and done unreal stuff today.” Sensing its queue my tail <br>
  whiplashed out behind me. “Nothing is simple anymore and everything frightens me. And you. Your <br>
  supposed to be a witch and evil by default. You aren't what I expected.”<br>
  “Old woman with a hunch back, raspy cackle and a pimple on her nose?” She asked in a bored voice. <br>
  “Cauldron and a cave?” I nodded guiltily. “Damn.<br>
  Stereotyping is a bitch. Yes, witches are bad, but I'm the exception to the rule.” She stepped <br>
  toward me and I stepped back, wary. She extended her hand and I eyed it warily. “Let's get this <br>
  done. Sorry to disappoint, but I don't peer into your palm and trace lines. Hold my hand, I won't <br>
  bite.”<br>
  Taking a deep breath, I reached out and clasped the undersized hand in mine. Ana's pupils dilated <br>
  into coin-sized black holes, swallowing the whites of her eyes. The skin on my fingers started to <br>
  tingle.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="461" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="462" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Incredible,” she breathed.<br>
  Her body became motionless, and her eyes hooded. They flickered rapidly trying to watch a million <br>
  things at once. My hand grew hot and she gripped me tighter. I flinched to pull away, but she held <br>
  on, astonishingly strong. She shrieked, a loud, short sound of pain and denial. A pulse of energy <br>
  shot down my arm, and my hand was wrenched from hers. We staggered back in shock of the connection <br>
  being broken, and I curled in on myself, blowing on my heated palm.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="463" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Ana face was clouded with indecision. “Oh Rae, what have you done,” she whispered.<br>
  Conall had a big question in his voice, “What have you seen?”<br>
  Ana said nothing, but watched me absorbedly. “Could you give us some space?”<br>
  He hesitated, but then nodded. Releasing me he blurred into a sprint and rocketed out of sight. <br>
  Again, it seemed demons were not big on goodbyes. After a few seconds deep silence, I fidgeted at <br>
  how intense Ana had become. My eyes darted to and from her gaze that never wavered from its mark.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="464" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Rae, you have many futures but two are clear. You stand at a precipice and I'm telling you, for <br>
  your own sake you need to step back.”<br>
  “I don't know what you mean.” I made a helpless gesture.<br>
  “The vampire, I see him in your future. He hails the end of people you care about and those you <br>
  have not yet met. Hear me.” Ana stepped forward, hand outstretched and face anguished. “You must <br>
  stop what you're doing. Turn away from that future. Plain enough for you?”<br>
  Understanding came to me then, and a name slipped through my parted lips. “Tomas.”<br>
  She paled to gray. “I warned Breandan he would seek you out. I thought he was deflected. They've <br>
  been hunting him for nearly a month now.” She swallowed, her unsteady breathing plainly revealing <br>
  her angst. “You must stay away from him. He is bad news,” she said. “You have no idea what he is <br>
  capable of. If he gets a hold on you we will be lost.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="465" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="466" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You don't have to worry.” I tired to sound calm and reassuring because she was freaking out. Her <br>
  face was all red and her hands waved about in the air frantically. “He's okay. He just wants to <br>
  talk. I'll hear him out and then he'll go.”<br>
  “You don't really believe that, do you? That a vampire has risked his life to come and tell you <br>
  something then run away into the night and leave you be?”<br>
  I flushed. It did sound improbable that Tomas would want to tell me something then leave, but what <br>
  else could he want?<br>
  “You have to tell me what's going on.”<br>
  Ana did not answer. Instead she drew herself up and was glaring at me again.<br>
  “There was a decision I did not understand, but now I see.” A sound of frustration gurgled in the <br>
  back of her throat. “I will not look further down that road, it is a disaster. If you keep this <br>
  secret about Maeve for much longer, it'll be the beginning of the end. Breandan may seem cold at <br>
  times, but he needs to be able to trust you. It is my purpose to reveal what counts, but if I tell <br>
  him Maeve may be If I tell him everything falls apart.” I said and did nothing. I stood and stared <br>
  at nothing, because once again I hadn't a clue what was going on. Ana cocked her head. “He hasn't <br>
  explained anything to you, has he?”<br>
  “We only met this morning and he's been busy hunting Tomas.”<br>
  Who I'm hiding in my wardrobe, I added silently. Realizing I'd rallied to Breandan's defense, I <br>
  pressed my lips together.<br>
  Exasperated, a hand flew to her hips, and she tutted. “Lochlann, Breandan's older brother is the <br>
  leader of a group of fairies who have broken away from Devlin's rule, and therefore the Tribe. <br>
  Rebels.”<br>
  My mouth flapped open. “What?” I spluttered. “Fairies have Tribes?”<br>
  Ana yawned, rubbed at her ear. “There is only one Tribe, the Tribe, ruled over by the fairy High <br>
  Lord, Devlin. Lochlann is a lord too, from one of the older families. After disagreeing with Devlin <br>
  about” Her eyes flicked back to me, and she dropped the ends of her sentence. “He took his family <br>
  and a few others with him. Then he left a month ago, and didn't say why or where he was going. He <br>
  just left us.” Her shoulders jerked once. “Some panicked and started to lose faith.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="467" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="468" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A few even went back to Devlin.”<br>
  Shaking my head, I caught up, and frowned. “Breandan took his place?”<br>
  She went pink and scowled at the floor. “He was as confused as the rest of us. Lochlann is not weak <br>
  or fickle. He had a reason for leaving, but it's hard to keep faith in such times as these. <br>
  Breandan and Maeve had their own private battle as to what should be done to lead the others until <br>
  he returned. But neither of them said anything directly to Lochlann's followers to soothe them. <br>
  Once, when it was really bad, I touched Breandan trying to get his attention, and I saw his <br>
  future.” She sighed and rubbed her head. “Before I thought it through I blurted it all out. <br>
  Naturally the rebels turned to him to lead.”<br>
  “What did you see?”<br>
  “Breandan standing over Devlin, victorious with a fairy-girl stood beside him. I saw alternates of <br>
  course, but when the fairy was gone Breandan failed and died. Lochlann comes back to his brother's <br>
  body and turns his back on us.”<br>
  Of course I was going to ask, “So, who's the fairy-girl?” “Seriously? I have to answer that <br>
  question?”<br>
  Pressing a hand to my throat, I searched for the invisible fingers crushing it. “How did you know <br>
  where to find me?”<br>
  “I saw you and Breandan running hand in hand behind the Wall. You wore the green blazer with the <br>
  Sect sigil. Oh, the fact you are training to be a Cleric went down a treat with the rebels, by the <br>
  way.” She sighed. “Damn that boy, I'd kick his ass if I didn't owe him. He played such a dangerous <br>
  game.”<br>
  I sunk to my knees amongst the leaves and settled down onto my bum, legs flopping weakly in front <br>
  of me. My hands burrowed into the dry dirt either side of me, and fisted beneath the surface.<br>
  “What game? How is any of this a game?”<br>
  “Wrong choice of words.” She waved her hands in apology. “Breandan sought you out, no matter how <br>
  much he may try to deny it. The moment I told him what I saw, he wanted to see you, but it's <br>
  screwed things up. I always saw you</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="469" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="470" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">bumping into each other and your love growing. I told him to stay away, that the time for your <br>
  meeting would happen naturally. Then I found out he was spying on you for the last month.” She <br>
  smiled. “This morning when you saw him, by the slope before you fell, he didn't help you up because <br>
  I called him away. You were not supposed to meet like that. But when you got lost the future <br>
  changed again, and in pops the vampires chance.” She grimaced and looked down at her hands. “But I <br>
  guess, it's my own fault for blurting out the truth.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="471" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“A few things are starting to make sense,” I said, and breathless, lifted a finger to signal time <br>
  out.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="472" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I thought of how Breandan reacted toward me the first time we'd met. He'd been horrified at who I <br>
  was, annoyed at me, and yet so persistent. Always coming back no matter how many times I told him <br>
  to back off, so sure that I had to listen and trust him. My wings curled around me, and my tail <br>
  flicked about behind me disturbing stone and insect. It was daunting to hear someone you had just <br>
  met and were beginning to feel something for had known you, and what you would become a long time <br>
  before you knew they existed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="473" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“And Devlin? How did he find out? I doubt Breandan would have proclaimed my existence to the <br>
  Tribe.” I remembered the reluctance in his expression when he held me for the first time. And I <br>
  remembered his words, the white witch was right and now I'll never hear the end of it. “And as <br>
  much as you tell me he wanted me meet me; I have a hard time believing it.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="474" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Ana pulled her top up and I recoiled. The skin across her stomach was a ghastly sight of lumpy <br>
  flesh and pink scars. “The Tribe caught me and I was not strong enough to hold my tongue.” Pulling <br>
  the top back down a tear rolled down her cheek. Scrubbing it away she looked disgusted at herself <br>
  for showing weakness. “Breandan saved me, and carried me to Conall for healing. But the cuts were <br>
  done with magic, and Devlin's consort, Wasp,” she spat the name, “is a tricky bitch with a special <br>
  gift for knife work.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="475" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I yanked my hair a few times, the feeling of helplessness threatening to overwhelm me. “Only you've <br>
  foretold this showdown between Breandan, Devlin and me?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="476" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“There has been no one with such a strong gift of Sight in a long time. I'm good and my gift has <br>
  yet to improve but trust me, I'm never wrong.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="477" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="478" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You can't see things, say, fifty years from now?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="479" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“That's not how it works. I don't see visions, I see future possibilities,” she explained wiggling <br>
  her fingers and nose. “I look at you or touch you and in my head I see you taking different <br>
  actions, making decisions and the future steps you take altering because of them. Like ghost images <br>
  moving on top of what I see. It's hard for me to attach time to it or remember it all. It doesn't <br>
  help I have a memory like a sieve. I judge time by appearance and significant events.” Ana's <br>
  creased face broke into a playful grin. “Sounds mental.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="480" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I hate to admit it, but you're one of the sanest people I've met today.” “I'm the most awesome <br>
  person you've met.”<br>
  There was a question that pressed on my mind. I didn't want to seem self- absorbed, but the more I <br>
  ignored it the louder intuition chimed it meant something, something big and scary.</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="482" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  “When I first met Breandan, he touched me and it feltstrange. Then he said something about us no <br>
  longer having a choice. That is was sealed. And a while ago Conall said he sensed something odd. I <br>
  think he was feeling thethe after effect of whatever it was.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="483" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Ana sucked in a breath. “Ah, that surprised even me, and boy did I feel it. The disturbance slammed <br>
  into me like a sledge-hammer. Others sensitive to such things would have sensed it too. The moment <br>
  it happened the future shifted so dramatically it gave me a killer headache.” She turned her head <br>
  and her eyes echoed her reaction to whatever future she saw moving over me. They looked haunted. <br>
  “But it does explain why you and Breandan coming together is so important. The connection itself, <br>
  well, it's happened once before and it didn't end well.” I threaded my fingers through the grass at <br>
  my side and waited. Ana focused hard on my face then looked away. “You must avoid speaking of it, <br>
  Rae. Don't tell anyone,” she said in a rush. “There are those who will not accept.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="484" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The sudden urgency threw me, and I leaned up. “Why? And don't evade the question.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="485" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">She saw my surly expression and sighed. “In the end they died and they took thousands of fairy <br>
  lives with them.” The curiosity in my face prompted her to continue. “The word you're looking for <br>
  to explain what you feel is a nexus.<br>
  When you touch something is created between you and Breandan that is unbreakable, untouchable. It <br>
  grows. The longer you are apart the greater the need for contact with him will become. When you do <br>
  touch it will be likelike a direct tap to the Source. The longer you are apart the greater the, ah, <br>
  release of energy will be.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="486" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">By the scared look on her face, I don't think the big release of energy was a good thing. The <br>
  larger implications of what she was saying sunk in and burned a hole.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="487" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“What if I don't want to be tied to him?” “It's done now.”<br>
  “But, I-, I still don't even know what it means.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="488" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="489" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Bonded ones can never rule or lead because they end up too wrapped in each other to think or see <br>
  straight.”<br>
  “That's not what I meant. What does it mean in real terms? Like does it mean Breandan and I are <br>
  destined to be together?”<br>
  The idea was so cliche it was gross, but it was one I understood easily.<br>
  “How the hell would I know?” I shot her a look. “Oh, you're forgetting what I can and can't do <br>
  again. I can tell you if you'll turn right down a fork in the road instead of left, but I can't <br>
  tell you why you chose that direction.” She paused thoughtfully. “Unless say, the right was blocked <br>
  and you had to go left. See what I mean?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="490" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">With a tremble, I digested what I had learned. Breandan and I were tied together by an unbreakable <br>
  magical bond, for life. And I wasn't even sure I liked him.<br>
  “Does Breandan know?” I asked.<br>
  “After you met the first time I saw what would happen should it grow beyond control. I warned him <br>
  to stay close and to touch you skin to skin as often as he could.” She grinned. “I don't think he <br>
  minded the instruction once he'd met you.”<br>
  “I don't understand. We can connect to the Source. Big deal. You can touch the Source.”<br>
  “This is more complex than a simple channeling of power. When the nexus opens you become a living <br>
  embodiment of the energy in its raw form. A Source in your own right.”<br>
  I frowned and chewed my lip. “Sounds intense.”<br>
  She barked a laugh and rubbed at her eyes. “You have no idea.”<br>
  I sensed her close up on the subject and thought of something else. “Why does Devlin want me to go <br>
  with him? He seemed very insistent that I go home with him.”<br>
  “This is where it gets complicated. Has Breandan or Conall explained the limits</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="491" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="492" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">of the Source yet?”<br>
  “I can get better at wielding magic with practice, but can never draw more than my limit.” I said, <br>
  proud of myself for remembering.<br>
  “Clever girl, but for you and Breandan the rule no longer applies. You're bonded.”<br>
  “Oh,” I said, neatly put in my place. “I see.”<br>
  Ana gazed above and her face was frightened. “There are three ancient items of magic in the form of <br>
  golden amulets pure fairies - Priestesses, whose purpose is to keep the balance of life - can wield <br>
  to make themselves extremely powerful, and become more connected to the Source. For nearly two <br>
  thousand years the balance was maintained. But then one Priestess forgot her purpose, and it got <br>
  out of whack. The dark outweighed the light, and things that never should have been possible <br>
  occurred.” Her face took on a sour look. “The Rupture was a side effect of her failure. If she was <br>
  doing job and keeping the balance, it never would have happened. The vampires would have been <br>
  stopped. But the result of that failure is clear to see, look at the world we live in.”<br>
  “You're looking for these amulets,” I said, “to try and bring back the balance. But Devlin has <br>
  other plans. It's like a race.”<br>
  She nodded. “A bloody sprint to see who can amass the most power before inevitable war. The <br>
  grimoire, a book of spells has been in the Tribe's possession since before anyone can remember. It <br>
  would be horrific if a force of evil was able to open it.” She shuddered delicately in the grass. <br>
  “The grimoire is locked, and the key is the three amulets combined, wielded by a pure fairy.”<br>
  “Why are you guys so worried then? If you have to be pure to-”<br>
  “It doesn't matter which type of pure you are. Pure evil can unlock the book just as pure good <br>
  can.”<br>
  “Who's the dumbass thought that gem up?”<br>
  “You did. Rather, one of your past reincarnations did.” “Ah,” I said.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="493" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="494" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Breandan lost an amulet piece this morning. It gives protection to the possessor.” She smiled at a <br>
  spider scuttling across her leg. She picked it up and held it in her palm, moved her hand this way <br>
  and that as the hairy brown arachnid searched for a place to get off. “Its guardian gave it to him <br>
  for safekeeping as he felt he could no longer conceal it.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="495" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The implications of what she was saying hit home. “So, the Tribe now has one amulet, and the rebels <br>
  have-”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="496" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Officially, none,” she said and grimaced. “Lochlann will not forgive Breandan easily for that <br>
  screw up. He became its protector, and left it unprotected to run around after you since you got <br>
  lost. Like I said before, I've saw that sticky spot you slid into with Maeve.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="497" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I scowled darkly. Everyone sounded so ready to bend over and take it from this fairy Lochlann, but <br>
  I didn't see him risking his hide to guard the amulet piece. Where was he? He was needed here.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="498" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Ana set the spider on the grass, and waved goodbye as it scurried away into the undergrowth.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="499" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Rae, the next time we hear strange noises in the forest, what do we do? “Go the other way,” I <br>
  mumbled.<br>
  “Correct.” She beamed at me. “Don't worry, all is not lost. We can even the score. There are two <br>
  more, hidden with their guardians and we'll find them, just you watch.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="500" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I let it all sink in. My hand unconsciously strayed to the pendant, no, the amulet piece lying <br>
  under my tee shirt. Ana honestly didn't seem to know that I had it. But Conall, Breandan and Devlin <br>
  did. Ana was a witch and gifted with the Sight. How could she not know that I was a guardian too? <br>
  Something was off. There were still large gaping holes in the tapestry that was being woven in my <br>
  mind.<br>
  Devlin was an evil fairy-lord. Pure evil and he wanted my amulet piece so that he could try to open <br>
  the grimoire. Lochlann, another bad ass fairy and Breandan's older brother was leading the <br>
  revolution to bring back the balance, and was therefore fighting against Devlin, which made him the <br>
  good guy, right? The grimoire was a scary powerful book that Devlin had, but couldn't open because <br>
  it was locked. Somewhere in the middle of this myself and two other</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="502" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">fairies had been chosen as guardians of the key, the amulets. I assume to keep them safe from evil, <br>
  because though my moral compass was dubious at the best of times, I didn't feel evil, which made me <br>
  good too, right?<br>
  But then why did I not know any of this? Why had I been dumped on the steps of a Temple Priests <br>
  house, glamoured as a human baby with no memory or knowledge of whom or what I was? Surely, if this <br>
  amulet were important it would be madness to entrust it to someone who may have just thrown it away <br>
  one day. Everything was falling into spaces, but some bits didn't fit.<br>
  One thing I knew for certain, though I was curious - who wouldn't be - I didn't want a part in any <br>
  of it. No matter what Ana thought it was too big for me. The whole political battle between the <br>
  rebels and the Tribe, and the battle between good and evil. The only reason I could see I was a <br>
  part of it was because of my connection to Breandan. After all, no long lost relative had come <br>
  forward to claim me.<br>
  The macabre tone of my thoughts had me scrambling around my own head for a distraction. “Uh, the <br>
  way you talk,” I said, “you consider yourself part of the fairy rebels?”<br>
  She snorted. “The gods created the Source and we all came from that. I don't care they look <br>
  different to me. We're made of the same basic stuff.”<br>
  “But you're human,” I said stubbornly taking in her normal ears, skin and lack of other limbs. <br>
  There was no glamour over her; I'd looked hard for it.<br>
  “If you want to get technical about it I'm the white witch, but for the most part yeah, human. You <br>
  are most definitely fairy.”<br>
  “So it's true then. All witches are bad? Barring you, I mean.”<br>
  Sadness flickered across her expression. “Fairies are magical. It is the essence of what they are, <br>
  and for the most part it protects them from influences that can rot a person to the core - <br>
  jealousy, greed and spite to name a few. Humans who can touch the Source, witches, do not have <br>
  these natural safeguards.”<br>
  “What makes you different?”<br>
  “The same thing that makes you different.” Her eyes lingered on my wings. “The</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="503" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="504" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">will of the gods.”<br>
  Stunned by her knowledge I pried without thinking. “How old are you?” “Fifteen.”<br>
  I thought back to when I was fifteen three years before. Trying to work out why my body was so <br>
  developed, and why I didn't want the boys to touch me like the other girls did. I compared myself <br>
  to this powerful girl and cringed. I went to pull my hood up but at Ana's stern look I rested my <br>
  fingers on the fabric, and my stomach clenched.<br>
  “I am in so much trouble. I don't think I can do this.”<br>
  She glared at me with a face of thunder. “You know what, this ‘oh no poor me’ routine has to stop, <br>
  Rae.”<br>
  “What?” I wailed. “I have a right to be upset.”<br>
  I raised my palms helplessly and swallowed the excess saliva building in my mouth.<br>
  “You don't have time to mope, or be worry about what's coming, because it's already here. Sorry to <br>
  be the one to break it to you, but it's crunch time. I wish you had more time to prepare, I do, but <br>
  fact is you don't. You need to face who you are and accept your place beside Breandan. The Tribe <br>
  has stolen the amulet of protection. They grow more powerful, and now they have one of the four. In <br>
  many futures you try to run but trouble finds you. If you don't accept this-”<br>
  Clamping a hand over my mouth, I leaped up and dashed into a corner before emptying my stomach onto <br>
  the ground. I heaved until nothing but clear, acidic liquid dribbled from my lips. My mind scuttled <br>
  over everything and I retched, puking air. Leaning my head on the cool stone I clung to the <br>
  trailing ivy rooted to the wall, and breathed in the light scent from flowers sprouting in-between <br>
  the gray bricks.<br>
  Pushing away from the wall I swayed back over to Ana. I let my legs give way so I was seated, <br>
  leaning forward limply.<br>
  “Chew this.” She pushed something green into my hand.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="505" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="506" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I stuffed it in my gob and chomped down. A clean taste exploded in my mouth, down my throat, and <br>
  into my belly until the nauseated feeling subsided. I spat the wad of green out of my mouth and <br>
  raised it in my upturned palm.<br>
  She motioned to the lump of weedy grass. “I laid a spell to help you.”<br>
  With bigger things to be upset about then a bit of magic, I tossed it and pushed hair out my eyes. <br>
  “How am I supposed to react to this?” Thinking on it I came up with nothing. My wings flexed behind <br>
  me and I sighed. “This is too big for me, it was too big when I found out I wasn't human.” My hand <br>
  drifted to touch an elongated ear; it twitched beneath my touch. “You're telling me that I have to <br>
  be with Breandan or he and his brother will fail in their quest to overthrow Devlin. I don't even <br>
  know why they are against him.”<br>
  Though I could guess. Devlin seemedcruel.<br>
  “I wish I could say something wise and comforting, but that's not what I'm here for. That's not my <br>
  purpose. But I know you'll make the right choice.” Leaning over to give me a hug she pressed her <br>
  cheek to mine. I stiffened. Moving away, she laughed quietly. “Oops, sorry. I forget.”<br>
  Shrugging it off, I plucked at the grass. “How do you manage with all this?”<br>
  She grinned. “It's cool. My strength is my Sight, but I can draw some power from the Source should <br>
  I want. I have known who and what I am since I can remember. The rebels are the only real family <br>
  I've ever known. I don't want to be without them.” We shared a smile before Ana looked up to the <br>
  night. “Nothing can compare to fairy kind.” She lay flat on her back, and I paused trying to figure <br>
  out how settle beside her.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="507" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A few minutes of unsuccessfully lying down and shifting into awkward positions I leaned up and <br>
  thought move out a little, and my wings moved out a little. I leaned back and the grass pricked the <br>
  skin between my shoulder blades. My wings folded up against my body to cocoon me; curving overhead. <br>
  The overall effect was snug as we watched clouds roll across the sky.<br>
  “Tell me about them?” I asked.<br>
  “They're all different, living solitary lives for the most part, even those sworn to the Tribe. The <br>
  majority remains Outside, but there are those who live within the</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="508" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="509" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Wall disguised as human, like me.”<br>
  “You're not a slum girl,” I said. “You talk like an upper dwell.” I wondered how many other demons <br>
  were living as ordinary humans. “It's strange to think of demons as so civilized. I'm used to <br>
  thinking of them as, well, something close to animals.”<br>
  Ana snorted a laugh. “Do you consider yourself as animal?” I chose to avoid answering that.<br>
  “Can you tell me how many demons there are?”<br>
  “My, my counting assets already.” She laughed at my blush. “The other demons have their own laws, <br>
  and I have no idea about their numbers. We believe the fairy number to be teetering at a thousand,” <br>
  her voice was proud. “There may be others hiding in the regions across the seas. Then there are the <br>
  outcast fairies.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="510" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My tail curled around my waist to jiggle in front of my eyes. I clasped the tip in one hand and <br>
  pushed it behind me. “You're going to get bored having to explain every comment to me really soon, <br>
  but outcast fairies?”<br>
  “It's nice to get a new perspective on things. Don't worry; you deal with all this rather well.” <br>
  She spoke with confidence, and scratched her nose. “Where was I?”<br>
  “The, uh, outcast fairies,” I reminded her.<br>
  “They hold no allegiance to the Tribe or us rebels, around three quarters of our<br>
  kind.”<br>
  “Why so many? Don't they like having someone to guide them?”<br>
  “Well, you have to think about it without taking sides. The fairies are divided into two squabbling <br>
  factions,” she made a sweeping gesture, “and wedged between the rest of the supernatural kingdom. <br>
  Make no mistake, we are the most powerful race.”<br>
  “Proud,” I said.<br>
  “Honest,” she said back. “The vampires launched the Rupture, and we had no</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="511" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="512" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">choice but to fight since the humans tarred all demons with one brush. It was either fight or be <br>
  slaughtered. Devlin has made relations between fairies and other demons terrible, unbearable. Made <br>
  mistakes that got us stuck in mess we are in now. If you were the outcast fairies, who would you <br>
  trust?”<br>
  There were once only two people in the world I trusted, I could relate. But still. Lightening split <br>
  the picturesque sky and the hairs on the back of my neck rose.<br>
  “Crazy,” I said.<br>
  “No, I am not and neither are you. This is the way it is.” She paused. “It could be worse.”<br>
  “Time is up,” a voice said from behind me.<br>
  Breandan had arrived with Conall a few steps behind. Streaks of mud dirtied his face and sculpted <br>
  chest, as if he had been rolling around on the floor. I didn't see any serious wounds on him, but <br>
  it was hard to tell under all those tattoos. I wondered again why he had so many. My gaze drifted <br>
  up his chest and locked with his. I picked up his intoxicating scent of earth and sun, and I <br>
  dragged in a lungful like it was a drug.<br>
  “Breandan,” someone squealed from a distance.<br>
  The world shunted back into focus and my eyes left his. Ana launched herself onto him and he <br>
  scooped her up into a bear hug, swung her round in a wide circle. I managed to keep a semblance of <br>
  calm, keep my expression neutral, and I'm proud to say I did not drag her off him by the hair.<br>
  “Ana,” he said solemnly. “Whatchasee?” “Everything,” she said, laughed.<br>
  “You made a joke,” I said then stood and busied myself brushing bracken off my jumper, refusing to <br>
  meet the curious stares. It was just that Breandan didn't seem the kind to crack a joke, and the <br>
  fact he was doing it with her and not me was irritating.<br>
  Beaming up at him, Ana swung her arms and smiled coyly. I was getting a definite crush vibe from <br>
  her. He dropped his hold on her and extended his hand</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="513" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="514" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">to me. I stepped forward to clasp it, felt contentment. He didn't ask about my missing glamour or <br>
  make reference to my changed form, and I was grateful. His eyes rested for a long while on my wings <br>
  then my tail. Heat crept up my neck and spilled into my cheeks. I ducked my head down so my hair <br>
  covered my face.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="515" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I peeked up, and Breandan's face was set, but glowing.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="516" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Ana rolled her eyes and ran her hand through her hair. “I'll see you soon, Rae. Try to remember <br>
  it's pointless to run from yourself.” She paused as the lightening above struck again. Taking a <br>
  last look at my face, she shook her head. “Be safe,” she called and made her way into the gloom of <br>
  the trees.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="517" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I barely heard or acknowledged her. The clouds darkened and the air hummed with electricity. The <br>
  panicky, manic urge to run made my breath come in shallow pants. I loved storms; already I could <br>
  feel my skin prickling.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="518" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall's face was turned to the sky. “Rae,” said and he looked at me. His eyes sparkled and cheeks <br>
  glowed with two spots of colour. “I still have much to show and tell you, but now is not the time. <br>
  I will see you soon and we'll frolic. Enjoy the storm.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="519" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He winked at me then the pale soles of his boots flashed through the trees, ponytail streaming <br>
  until he was lost to sight. Man, he was fast.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="520" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It was hard to concentrate with the ruckus overhead. My palms began to sweat. My wings twitched <br>
  madly, and my tail thrashed so quickly it almost vibrated. I concentrated hard on a single action <br>
  before turning to face Breandan. I brought my fist hurtling forward and encountered air. His face <br>
  creased with amusement as he moved with the fluidity of water. My punch missed him by a mile and in <br>
  a move to fast for me to defend against Breandan spun to my front, grabbed my leg and opposite arm <br>
  to hold me taut above his head. I wriggled and writhed unable to break his hold. The first fat <br>
  drops of rain landed on my cheeks and neck.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="521" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You have not been taught to fight well,” he said calmly despite my tail thumping his face.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="522" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I cannot believe you didn't tell me you arrogant, stupid sonofa-” “Oh, you're mad,” he said and <br>
  dropped me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="523" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="524" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I landed lightly on my feet, wings jack-knifing out to beat hard beside me. Straightening in a <br>
  flash I got in his face. “Stop throwing me about.”<br>
  “You are not a weakling. To treat you as such would be an insult.”<br>
  As if channeling my anger lightening flashed. Thunder crashed behind it and the rain started to <br>
  fall harder. The trees began to sway in the wind, boughs bowed steeply.<br>
  “You moron,” I said and seethed with anger.<br>
  His face flickered with hurt before falling blank. “What exactly are you upset about?”<br>
  “I looked like a fool. I didn't even know there were rebels or amulets that could sway the balance <br>
  of power into the hands of evil,” I sucked in a breath. “You told me nothing. Nothing.” Regulating <br>
  my voice to conversation level, I thrust my hands into my pockets and pulled my wings back, <br>
  embarrassed. The fire to fight left me and I felt an urge for the comfort of four walls. Rain <br>
  plastered my hair to my head, dripped from my nose and fingertips. I closed my eyes and breathed in <br>
  the scent of the wet soil beneath me. “I'm the guardian of one third of the key, aren't I? That's <br>
  what this thing is hanging around my neck. But why didn't Ana know and why do you, Conall and <br>
  Devlin know?” My voice was barely a whisper. “I feel lost.”<br>
  Breandan drew me into him and his chest heaved with a sigh. His hand met the skin at my shoulder <br>
  blades, between my pinions, and he started there. He stroked my wings in long, sweeping movement. I <br>
  relaxed and let his touch soothe my body and mind. I was too stressed to deny myself this pain <br>
  relief. No matter how twisted a message it gave.<br>
  “We should be enjoying the storm,” he said gently.<br>
  I looked into his face and unsuccessfully tried to hide my shock. “We like storms?”<br>
  He shook his head; a rash excitement lit his eyes. “We love storms. Our nature sings to its tune. <br>
  You should see us during heat waves.”<br>
  I blushed deeply. “All this time I thought it was strange. The urges I got to run</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="525" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="526" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">and dance. I could never figure it out.”<br>
  “Do you want to talk about what you've learnt?”<br>
  And just like that I was stiff. “You mean how you're running around leading a rebel demon force <br>
  until your brother gets his deserting ass back here?” My voice shook again.<br>
  “Ana was wrong to scare you like that,” he said.<br>
  I composed myself. It would be silly for me not to ask him anything. “Wait.” I pressed my hands <br>
  into his chest. Rapt, I watched my fingertips sink into the firm, smooth skin. “I have a question <br>
  about the Tribe's last Priestess, the one who shifted the balance.” To make myself feel better I <br>
  slid my fingers down his hard abs, developing a whole new appreciation for touching him.<br>
  Breandan looked perplexed. “I thought you didn't want to talk about this.”<br>
  “I want to know more about fairies. I want to know more about you. Avoid the bits about me, okay?”<br>
  He stroked my hair and tilted my head so he could hold my eyes. “Ask.” “You lead the rebels now? <br>
  Until your brother gets back, I mean.”<br>
  “Yes. The majority are sensible allowing me freedom to pursue other interests. Few break the rules. <br>
  When they do they are found by the warriors, and brought to me for judgment. We're a solitary <br>
  people. We don't need a ruler to dictate everyday life.”<br>
  I chewed my lip, slotting the information in with what I already knew. “The Tribe is lead by the <br>
  High Lord, right?”<br>
  His hand went still on my back and after half a breath resumed its gentle rub.<br>
  “Yes. The fairy High Lord has held the Tribe for centuries and lived more years than I, but less <br>
  than Lochlann. Those under his charge are still alive and only the last fifty years has he allowed <br>
  himself to be overcome by his baser nature.”<br>
  “How many centuries has he held the Tribe?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="527" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="528" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Seven,” he answered.<br>
  I blinked at his words. “Seriously?” He stayed quiet and I drummed up courage. “How long have you <br>
  been alive?”<br>
  His lips twitched. “Twenty years. I'm little more than a child in the eyes of some.”<br>
  My fingers scrunched together on his chest, left shallow slashes that healed the instant I made <br>
  them.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="529" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I knew you were older, but I never figured the gap was that small.” I laughed in relief. “I'm <br>
  eighteen.”<br>
  “You're not eighteen.”<br>
  I frowned. “Uh, yes I am.”<br>
  Breandan slid one of his hands to entwine his fingers with mine. His other tilted my head up and <br>
  held my chin. “Rae, you were born two hundred years ago.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="530" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The warmth of his touch helped smother the rumbling of hysteria into a tremble. “I don't <br>
  understand.”<br>
  “You're birth would have superseded mine, but something happened. The little I've found out <br>
  suggests your birth mother laid a spell on you to-”<br>
  “Stop.” I tried to pull my head away, wiggle my hand free. Breandan held firm. “Be calm.”<br>
  “I told you I don't want to talk about me.”<br>
  “You told me you wish to know of the Priestess.” “Yeah,” I said wary. “I do. Who was she?”<br>
  I knew who she was. Of course I knew, but I needed to hear him say it. “The last pure fairy and <br>
  tribal Priestess was your birth mother.” He paused</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="531" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="532" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">letting me take this in. “She gave you that amulet and hid you among the humans.”<br>
  “What-” I swallowed hard. “What did she do to tip the balance? Her bad decision what was it?”<br>
  “She chose to break her vow to her husband and lie with a human male.” “The human male was my <br>
  father?”<br>
  Breandan shook his head. “No. You are pure-blooded fairy. As is-” Cutting off his jaw clenched, and <br>
  for once, he avoided my gaze.<br>
  “Whatever it is you're keeping from me I will find out. You need to start being honest with me.” <br>
  The hypocrisy of my words had me cringing inside.<br>
  “Some secrets are not mine to tell.”<br>
  I rubbed at my face and nodded. Considering the secrets I held, I was not going to push him. “Okay. <br>
  So she broke her vow to my dad, got in trouble. How does that break the balance?”<br>
  “Your father killed the human and your mother. She didn'thandle it well.” “She got mad and did it <br>
  on purpose, you mean.”<br>
  “Her heart was broken and she could no longer see the reason for her being. She abandoned her <br>
  purpose and split the amulet in three. She gave two of the pieces to those who were closest to her <br>
  heart. The amulets of protection and,” he touched my chest where my pendant lay, “wisdom.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="533" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I stifled a laugh. This thing was supposed to inspire me with wisdom? Yeah right, like anything I <br>
  had done in the last day had been wise.<br>
  “And the other?”<br>
  He shrugged. “We are not sure.” He stroked a finger down the bridge of my nose. “Do you feel better <br>
  informed now?”<br>
  “At least I understand some of why this is happening to me. Why you're so</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="534" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="535" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">eager to be with me.”<br>
  “No matter how you try to reason it, you belong to me and I to you. No matter what has happened in <br>
  the past, or future forces that will try to keep us apart.<br>
  Lochlann will return and take his rightful place. Then I can focus on helping you become who you <br>
  are destined to be.”<br>
  Who was I destined to be? I didn't feel ready to hear what I knew was coming, and I threw a <br>
  question at him before he could continue.<br>
  “We are immortal?”<br>
  “We live for millennia, but are relatively easy to kill if damaged quickly enough so we cannot <br>
  heal.” Contempt entered his tone. “Vampires are immortal.”<br>
  Uh oh. No. I did not want to talk about vampires.<br>
  “It's too heavy, let's change topic,” I said hastily. “Tell me why you left the Tribe, I want to <br>
  understand what I'm facing. Were you just following Lochlann?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="536" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“The decision was mine, and I made it. The Tribe is made up of simple fairies trying to live their <br>
  lives. There are a core few devoted to Devlin and his way of life. These influence and control the <br>
  rest. It is because of them demonkind is experiencing the darker side of the fairy race.” He face <br>
  was sad. “It's their nature which leads them to dominate. To twist things for their own gains.”<br>
  “They're evil,” I said.<br>
  “Yes,” he replied bluntly. “I will not pretend that my brother is a saint, but he wants peace. <br>
  Lochlann wishes to bring back the old ways.”<br>
  I pressed my fingertips to his face; let them trail along his scar to his jaw, careful this time <br>
  for my talons not to scratch him.<br>
  “And you think that will be a good thing?”<br>
  He shrugged. “It cannot be worse than how we are now.”<br>
  “Lochlann is losing. He was hoping to have two amulets, but now he has none</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="537" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="538" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">and the Tribe has one.” Breandan stiffened and his jaw cracked beneath my hand. “Apart from you, <br>
  the rebels have no clue where any of the amulets are, but Devlin knows I have a piece.” At the <br>
  surprise and hesitation I caught passing his face, something clicked for me. “Lochlann knows,” I <br>
  said. “He thinks he knows where one is. That's why he left so suddenly, isn't it?”<br>
  I had my own suspicions as to where an amulet piece was, but if Lochlann had left his entire rebel <br>
  force to go find it, surely I was wrong.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="539" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan shrugged, not bothering to deny it. “He would not leave us for such a long time if it <br>
  wasn't important.”<br>
  “You should have told me all this.” My hand dropped as my face became as mad as my voice. “I've <br>
  been fumbling around in the dark.” I pressed a hand to the space beneath my collarbones where the <br>
  amulet piece lay. “I've been a target this whole time and you didn't warn me.”<br>
  “I'm protecting you. We didn't want you worrying about your birthright. Concentrate on getting used <br>
  to your true form.”<br>
  “Gods, Breandan, enough already. Be plain, what is my birthright?”<br>
  “If I knew you would not overreact I would. As it stands, you had better ask Conall the next time <br>
  you see him.”<br>
  Resting my forehead on his chest, I smelt the woods he liked to run in. Head butting it hard, I <br>
  placed my hands on his sides.<br>
  “You can't protect me from everything. I need to know these things sooner rather than later. You <br>
  put me in more danger by keeping me in the dark.”<br>
  “Yes I can, he said matter of fact. “I may have failed my brother and my sister, but I will not <br>
  fail you.”<br>
  At the mention of Maeve, I froze. My heart sunk to somewhere below the soles of my feet.<br>
  “Why do you think you have failed your sister?”<br>
  “Maeve has not returned. When one of us goes missing for so long-” He sighed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="540" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="541" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No. It does me no good to think such thoughts.”<br>
  Leaning away I saw the pain in his eyes. Clasping my hands around him I pressed my eyes closed, and <br>
  listened to the truth I desperately wanted to say crawling around my head. He needed to know what <br>
  had happened to her, but he was already so upset about losing the amulet piece entrusted to him, <br>
  which in a way was my fault too. If he hadn't been so distracted by me crashing around in the <br>
  woods, lost, he would have been more on guard to defend against the thief.<br>
  “I'm trouble,” I said. “One day you will hate me for it.”<br>
  Breandan pulled me away to kiss my eyelids, forehead and cheeks. “You're mine,” he said. “The one <br>
  thing I want for myself, and I could never hate you.” A gush of warm air down my throat made me <br>
  smile. He stroked the bridge of my nose and followed his finger with kisses. “There is danger for <br>
  you everywhere.<br>
  Devlin is convinced you are key to the future. And you are right. He knows you have an amulet, but <br>
  he cannot just take it. It must be given freely. The Tribe will try to take you from me, but <br>
  together we are safe.”<br>
  His words made me feel ill. I was lying to him, and all he wanted was for me to feel safe. I didn't <br>
  deserve his trust. After all, I hadn't given him all of mine.<br>
  Before he could kiss my lips, I darted away.<br>
  Soon, I heard the tinkling of water, and came to a small stream. It was lovely, the craggy rocks <br>
  and clear, crisp water. I drank until I was satisfied, and wiped my mouth on the back of my hand.<br>
  Something bright and golden caught my gaze in the glassy waters reflection.<br>
  My skin glowed. Ear tips slender, and elongated to points peeked through my wild halo of hair. I <br>
  took out the twig holding it up, and it cascaded down, the inky tips resting slickly across my <br>
  back. My tail snaked through the air over my shoulder, and my wings rustled. They were gold. Not a <br>
  light brown or pretty hazel but dark, powerful gold that matched my eyes and wrapped around my <br>
  shapely body. My mouth opened to gasp and I saw the brilliance of my teeth, sharp and fang like. <br>
  The small whimper of sound that escaped sounded like chinking crystal. My eyes, sparkling pools of <br>
  light, widened. I hesitantly ran a finger over my shapely jaw, and tilted my head slightly to the <br>
  side. My profile was sleeker, yet softer and more regal. I looked beautiful and I took my own <br>
  breath away. I was scary, a demon.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="542" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="543" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Rae.” Breandan's voice was smooth and warm. He waited for me a few paces away.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="544" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It was this moment I realized how much I needed him safe. He was in danger, because Devlin wanted <br>
  him dead. There had to be something, some way to keep him safe. The thought sent an icy chill down <br>
  my spine. It was the first time in my life I had ever thought of someone else's wellbeing before <br>
  my own, and how was I supposed to protect him from forces I barely understood?<br>
  He jumped over the pool and landed on the other side, dislodging a few pebbles that rolled down and <br>
  plopped into the water. The ripples that fanned out distorted my reflection.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="545" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan's face was lit up, glowing with excitement. “Enough doom, follow me,” he said.<br>
  I lost myself. We raced the thunder to where the lightening had struck. It was Breandan's <br>
  favorite game. We pushed each other about playfully, and played a demented game of hide and seek. <br>
  Demented, because we could sense each other. There was nowhere to hide. I came to a stop, my chest <br>
  heaving and breath coming hard. I pressed my front against a tree and waited. Strong arms <br>
  enveloped me from behind, and I forgot I was in the embrace of a powerful demon as the storm raged <br>
  around us. I pushed Breandan away and twirled.<br>
  Hands spread, head flung back, I giggled as I tripped over my own foot. He caught me before I fell, <br>
  and chuckled, cradling me in his arms.<br>
  Was being a demon meant to be fun? I still felt like me, like the Rae I always had been, just with <br>
  a few extras.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="546" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Thank you for explaining,” I said, genuinely grateful. I gripped his shoulder to beam into his <br>
  luminous face. For the first time that day, everything didn't look so dark.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="547" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I know you wish to be normal, human, but soon you will see there is nothing better than what you <br>
  are.” He set me on my feet and scrubbed a hand over his head. “When Lochlann returns we will be <br>
  able to spend more time together, having fun.” His eyebrows pulled together and his face became <br>
  thoughtful. “I worry I'm not doing this thing properly. I've never been bound to another before.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="548" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="549" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Biting back a smile, on an impulse I pressed my fingers to his face. He lifted my other hand to <br>
  press it to his heart.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="550" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“It's not bad,” I admitted. “I thought it would be, but the more I think about it, the less scary <br>
  being tied to you seems.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="551" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The, thing between us was complicated and tricky. I still hadn't told him about Maeve or the <br>
  vampire-boy in my wardrobe. The thought distracted me, and tugged me from the dreamlike state I was <br>
  in. I needed to get back to Temple.<br>
  Tomas was probably beyond pissed off right now and pacing my room like a caged predator.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="552" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan smiled wickedly, clearly delighted. He stole a kiss and jogged backward. His face filled <br>
  with mischief.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="553" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“A race,” he suggested and crooked his finger at me playfully.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="554" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I grinned; skipped to join him then ran, hearing his laughter behind me. I noticed my sense of <br>
  direction since I had become a demon was stellar. My centre of gravity was rooted to everything <br>
  around me. I moved and it shifted in relation to the direction of north. I knew how far I was from <br>
  water, a deep cave or from a high place.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="555" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I got back first and wondered if he had let me win. Stomping my boots, mirroring the pound of my <br>
  heartbeat, I did more happy spins, waiting to get dizzy and for Breandan to come catch me. Round <br>
  and round I spun.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="556" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A figure, darker than the coming night stepped from the gloom and motioned to me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="557" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I stopped dead.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="558" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Head spinning, a cry of panic was already bubbling in my throat. I drew in a deep breath, and <br>
  reached to the Source. Not the best of ideas since I was hardly proficient, having only used it a <br>
  few times before, but I was facing evil and it was no time to be scared of what I was, or what I <br>
  could do.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="559" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A warm hand closed around my waist and pulled me back, shielded me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="560" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My lungs collapsed, and a squawk of alarm was replaced with knee watering</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="561" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="562" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">relief. I released my hold on the energy I'd gathered, felt it flow in a warm stream of power from <br>
  my fingertips.<br>
  Breandan, eyes flashing blue fire stepped forward.<br>
  Devlin's laughter made my skin scrawl. “Breandan, you always were overprotective of your toys.” He <br>
  eased into a comfortable stance. He moved closer then I could see his face better. The sparkle in <br>
  his eye seemed devilish now and the curve of his lips sinister.<br>
  “It is not overprotective to defend what is yours,” Breandan replied and glanced over his shoulder.<br>
  I tried to do him proud and look less terrified. Yeah right. I was shaking like a leaf. Devlin had <br>
  worked magic on me a few hours ago, and it had worked. I remembered the mumbling, quivering mess I <br>
  had been and felt sick. If Breandan and Conall hadn't come along, I would have probably given him <br>
  my amulet and agreed to go wherever it was he was trying to lure me to.<br>
  Losing his patience, Breandan shifted, easing his feet apart and asked, “What do you want?”<br>
  Devlin pointed to me. “She has spoken to the most powerful Seer of our time, the white witch. She <br>
  is a fairy born of this region and by rights part of my Tribe unless she swears fealty to a <br>
  usurper. I have a right to know what her future holds.”<br>
  “Touch her and I kill you.”<br>
  “By doing this, denying me the right to see her, you are naming her a prisoner or of your faction. <br>
  If she swears fealty to Lochlann she will be named a rebel. She already has had a hard life at the <br>
  hands of her mother. Will you truly subject her to a lifetime of being shunned by the majority of <br>
  her true kind too?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="563" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan's face was ashen. He swallowed hard and looked at me over his shoulder, expression torn. I <br>
  understood what Devlin was saying. Because I hadn't chosen a side I was automatically a Tribal <br>
  fairy, but since Breandan had claimed me as his own he'd sentenced me to a life filled with death <br>
  and destruction. I would have to always be cautious, always have to hide the amulet and myself. I <br>
  was beginning to think even if I lost my piece I would still be tied</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="564" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="565" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">to it. It would explain why Devlin did not grab the thing a month ago and take off.<br>
  Like Breandan said, there were rules to this thing. I just had to learn them.<br>
  In that moment I also realized it didn't matter what Breandan wanted or what Devlin wanted, but <br>
  what I wanted. My moral compass was crooked at best, but I would never choose to be evil. But nor <br>
  was I so saint like, that I wanted to be part of a fairy revolution. I cared deeply for Breandan, <br>
  maybe it was impossible for me not too, and so I stepped closer to him. If he let his nature rule <br>
  him, Devlin could over power him easily. He needed to keep a level head, for what I had planned. I <br>
  placed a hand on his shoulder and looked up into his face, my eyes pleading for him to calm down.<br>
  “Know you have forced my hand, cousin.” Devlin's voice twanged with power and I turned in time to <br>
  see his glamour drop.<br>
  His hair ignited, blazing with white light. His ears were elongated and had the point of fairy I <br>
  found fascinating, but his face was so sharp, pristine in its formation my eyes found it hard to <br>
  settle on one feature. His eyes were aflame, cold green flames. His hands and feet were clawed, <br>
  wickedly spiky. I saw clearly now the difference between him and Breandan in their true forms. <br>
  Devlin was a leader, powerful in his righteous hate for the rebels who threatened his authority. <br>
  Breandan had his own power, but it was not born of dominance.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="566" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I caught the glint at Devlin's chest as he shifted to set his feet apan, and my suspicion was <br>
  confirmed. The colour and shape of it was too distinctive to be anything else other than an amulet <br>
  piece.<br>
  Blinded by the urge to take it from him, I lurched forward. Breandan, confused by my behavior, <br>
  pulled me back and tucked me under his arm.<br>
  Emerging from the shadows behind Devlin, fairies unsheathed their weapons. His eyes narrowed and <br>
  skipped around the trees.<br>
  “Tron and Loki are dead,” said the willowy male to his immediate left. Lanky, his grey hair flowed <br>
  on and on until it hit his knees. With pinched eyes and scraggly grey beard, his wrinkled face <br>
  reminded me of the crushed velvet I had once seen decorating a Temple Priests robes. Clutched in <br>
  his hand was a halberd. He jabbed it toward Breandan. “He caught their scent.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="567" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="568" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">That explained why Breandan had been delayed in racing me. I felt a surge of pride.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="569" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No matter,” Devlin grated, a trace of irritation flickering across his expression. “Lochlann was <br>
  always the better fighter. Four against two is more than enough. Wasp, my love?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="570" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The wraithlike fairy-girls face blazed adoration and lunacy as she turned to him. Her long hair was <br>
  a tangle of claret dreadlocks that seemed alive, like snakes writhing around her face. Wide eyes <br>
  glassy, her pouty green lips parted, waiting.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="571" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Would you do the honor of taking Rae? Be careful not to break her, she can be quite <br>
  temperamental.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="572" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Mouth curling sadistically, she licked the edge of her blade. A flash of memory showed Ana pulling <br>
  up her top to expose the scars carved into her flesh by this very demon. My stomach heaved and my <br>
  lungs sucked air in heaving gulps.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="573" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Another male fairy slid closer, eager. An acre of green chest bared his copper Mohawk stood high <br>
  from his head in stiff spikes. His almond eyes focused on Breandan, and his pierced tongue flicked <br>
  out in anticipation.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="574" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <h2 id="chp7" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Chapter Seven</h2>
  <p class = "para1" id="575" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  They feinted around us in a loose circle and tightened inch by inch. I twisted my head round to <br>
  watch Breandan's back, and wished I had a weapon. Anything, a big stick, would do. Failing sunlight <br>
  highlighted the last leaves of autumn. They twisted into grotesque and beautiful shapes in the air <br>
  as they twirled down. And then I was frightened. Knee trembling and suffocating on my own air, <br>
  petrified that Breandan would die here, defending me and I would end up with these psychopaths for <br>
  the rest of my life. Trapped, forever.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="576" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“What do we do?” I kept my hands clamped around his waist. My neck ached from trying to see in <br>
  every direction at once.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="577" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Slowly, the Tribe fairies drew closer with their leader closest. The prospect of wining so alive in <br>
  his eye, Devlin seemed a lunatic.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="578" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan searched my face for something then said, “Run.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="579" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No.” My voice only wobbled a little. I would not leave him here, no matter how afraid I was.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="580" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Hear me, Rae.” There was deep persuasion in his words as he tried to compel me. “You must run.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="581" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I snorted at the stupid idea of him giving his life for mine. As if I could live without him after <br>
  he'd gone and made me all devoted and loyal. We would leave together or not at all. I was ready to <br>
  die here, with him. They would have to kill me for I would never stop trying to kill them if <br>
  Breandan died.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="582" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He shook his head in a movement so infinitesimal I could barely see it. “I can't defend against <br>
  their spells and conjure a portal to take us. I don't have enough focus. Please, Rae.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="583" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No,” I repeated, firmer this time.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="584" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Hissing, I bared my teeth at the copper haired fairy as he took a large, crouched step toward us. <br>
  His hand twitched on the hilt of his knife. The lack of light made his titled eyes sinister in what <br>
  would be a handsome face.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="585" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="586" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“What about Conall?” I asked in a burst of smarts. For a second time he shook his head.<br>
  We needed to escape, and an idea tickled the back of my mind. I knew magic was the only way to <br>
  survive this, but if what I was planning didn't work we would die, painfully. The alternative, <br>
  Breandan fighting three fairies singlehanded, was not an option. I would not die like this, trapped <br>
  and afraid because I was worth much more. I was strong and smart. Less than a day ago when I had <br>
  believed I was human, I'd been the best at everything I did, and I was not set on changing that <br>
  now. I was strong and I had magic.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="587" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I'm a demon,” I murmured, locking my sights on the amulet.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="588" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I shifted away so I had room to move. Breandan's gaze flashed to my face, puzzled by my change of <br>
  tone. He clasped my hand as if to keep me anchored to him.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="589" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The fairies launched their attack. Teeth and blades glinting, they lunged for us. Lurching forward <br>
  to meet their charge, I smashed my fist into Devlin's chest and scrunched my fingers together until <br>
  I felt the cold, hard press of the amulet and simplymoved. We were shunted sideways. Pushing <br>
  through a thick, unyielding wall of rubbery substance. It stretched against me, refusing entry, but <br>
  I forced the pressure to abide my will and felt us slip through the hole that opened. Our <br>
  surroundings shifted from vibrant green to faded grey stone.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="590" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I stumbled, releasing both Breandan and Devlin in shock at the abrupt shift of location. Shocked <br>
  and a little misty eyed, I looked down at the palm-sized green and gold amulet clutched in my fist. <br>
  Runes I didn't recognize were etched into the circumference, and it had two smaller rings in the <br>
  circle. It looked like you could slot two smaller pieces in. I had hoped Devlin would have slotted <br>
  the two pieces the Tribe had together, but this was only one third. The power of it hummed, rattled <br>
  my bones. The amulet seemed to sigh and ripples of power slid across my hand, up over my torso and <br>
  flowed over my legs. Biting down as it adjusted itself to its new master. Then it bubbled out, <br>
  extending until I felt more connected to everything. Huh? I didn't feel protected, I felt wide <br>
  open. I knew my amulet was meant to inspire wisdom (yeah right), but his one was meant to protect. <br>
  I made a noise of triumph that morphed into one of annoyance. I'd meant to leave Devlin behind with <br>
  the others and take us to my dorm room, not</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="591" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="592" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">the crumbling church I'd met the white witch in earlier. And, I had meant for this damn thing to go <br>
  to Breandan, not attach itself to me. I tried to drop it on the floor hoping it would reverse <br>
  whatever had happened, but my hand wouldn't let it fall.<br>
  The gods be damned, I could not catch a break.<br>
  I stuffed the amulet in my pocket then the sheer impossibility of what I had done caught up with <br>
  me. Giggling in disbelief my brain rattled in my skull, settling back into place as I toppled over <br>
  to puke my guts up. Scraping my mouth with the back of my hand, I whirled in fright at the <br>
  commotion behind me.<br>
  Devlin and Breandan darted around each other in smooth, bold movement. The fight was beastly and <br>
  magnificent. Their speed alternated from painfully slow to supernaturally fast. I couldn't see half <br>
  the moves they executed, but when I could I felt sick.<br>
  The need to protect Breandan submerged the rock of my fears in a sea of courage. Confident we had <br>
  broken away from Devlin's guard, I felt for the Source. Grasping the pulsing energy a wave of <br>
  nausea rolled over me, head to toe. Stomach heaving and pitching dangerously, I steadied my legs. <br>
  My attention was drawn once again to the fight at the sound of a pained grunt. Gone was the <br>
  illusion of normalcy and tentative peace. Both feral and vicious, the boys feinted around the space <br>
  with lethal intent. Breandan and Devlin smacked each other about with their fists and feet, and <br>
  loud thumps, and hollow crunches accompanied each blow.<br>
  I spat a curse and planted my feet, swallowed the bile burning the back of my throat and nose. It <br>
  tasted sour. I drew deeply on the Source until I thought my body would burst from the pressure <br>
  bubbling my blood. Focusing my energies on what I wanted was hard. Each of Devlin's punches on <br>
  Breandan's body was like a blow to my own. I molded the mass of chaotic energy I summoned into a <br>
  fist of air, panting under the strain.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="593" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan lost concentration; eyes darting to mine they filled with concern. Victory flashed across <br>
  Devlin's face as he struck with fatal precision.<br>
  Releasing air, I reached to fire. A ball of light appeared before me and grew. Larger, and larger <br>
  until I realized it was more than I could control. Breandan would be too close to use the damn <br>
  thing, so what did I do with it? The flames</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="594" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="595" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">stared to burn blue then whips of white started to flash across its surface. “Rae, hold very, very <br>
  still and do not let it go.”<br>
  I looked up to see Breandan and Devlin had stopped fighting. They stood side by side, and the alarm <br>
  on their faces terrified me.<br>
  My lip trembled and the fireball bloated slightly.<br>
  Breandan took a hesitant step toward me. “Rae, love, please stay calm.”<br>
  “I think I think it's a little big,” I said nervously. “At least you've stopped fighting.”<br>
  “It was either stop or watch you kill us all,” Devlin said angrily.<br>
  A ferocious hate blazed across Breandan's face as he looked at the fairy-lord, but he schooled his <br>
  expression and focused on me. His face was blank, but his eyes were tight. “It's going to be fine. <br>
  I want you to do exactly what I say, alright?”<br>
  I nodded manically. The ball of fire hovered in front of me, rolling, expanding and collapsing in <br>
  on itself slightly. What would happen if it exploded in my face?<br>
  “I have courage and I can do this,” I said out loud. Devlin rolled his eyes.<br>
  “Yes,” Breandan agreed. “You are very brave. Now, I want you to think of the fire ball as the <br>
  wind.”<br>
  “Like a tornado?” “No!”<br>
  The fireball lengthened, and spun into a cyclone of flames. A face flashed into my mind and then it <br>
  was off, sucking Devlin into its centre. Consumed in wildfire he bellowed in anger. The fire <br>
  swirled into a glowing ball leaving him singed, but unharmed. He bounced the bloated sphere of <br>
  death in his palm then hurled it toward Breandan.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="596" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="597" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Stop,” I cried and reached out to call the power back.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="598" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The fire winked from existence, but the heat of it enveloped me. Falling to my knees, I batted at <br>
  the small fires that erupted on my clothes, and watched in confusion as the fist of air I'd <br>
  conjured hurtled toward the fairy-boys, who had returned to their fight. I was powerful enough to <br>
  conjure two spells at once?<br>
  Even as I realized something was wrong with my conjuring, my eyes widened at the glow surrounding <br>
  them, and I understood too late they used magics of their own.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="599" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The casting broke with such impact the ground shook.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="600" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Shields conjured for protection bent and exploded. Both boys were flung back and carried by an <br>
  unstoppable force. The churning energy of their spells rent apart fanned out, like ripples in a <br>
  still pond. I vibrated as the force encountered my mass and hammered it. I was thrown from my <br>
  knees, and kicked across the floor at breakneck speed. Each ripple slammed and beat at me until all <br>
  I could do wait for it to end. A wall was in my way and as I crashed through it the stone dragged <br>
  at my skin. I lay dazed. Unable to move, think or breathe. Black spots danced across my vision and <br>
  my ears filled with a high note of sound. I scrunched my eyes shut. There was blood in my mouth and <br>
  dirt rammed to back of my throat. I couldn't smell anything, my nose felt thick and throbbed. <br>
  Amulet of protection my left butt cheek. I gasped, my chest expanding to suck in air in heaving <br>
  gulps. The busted up thing known as my body was numb.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="601" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A hand pressed on me, checking I was whole. “Breandan,” I sobbed. “It hurts so bad.”<br>
  Coughing up speckles of dirt, I lay a hand on my chest and brought it away to see dark red.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="602" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Lie still.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="603" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The voice, familiar yet unwelcome caused bizarre dread to gush through me. It was not the voice I <br>
  wanted to hear.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="604" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Get off me,” I said, breathless. “Don't touch me.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="605" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Despite the pain I wrestled and twisted and attacked with my hands but Devlin</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="608" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Let go.” Breandan loomed above, not a scratch on him. His blade bit into Devlin's jugular drawing <br>
  blood that trickled to soak his collar. Yet he hesitated to let me go. I glared up at him like he <br>
  was a mad man. “Now,” he snapped.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="609" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan clasped my extended arm and pulled me into him, keeping his eyes deadlocked on Devlin. On <br>
  his knees, Devlin's hair and eyes were half crazed. My blood stained his hands, and his clothes <br>
  were singed and smoking at the edges.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="610" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">If I were a were-cat I would be roaring.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="611" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My heart battered my chest as I reached the conclusion the fight had ended. Breandan had won, and I <br>
  saw in Devlin's face he was facing something nasty. The defeat at the hands of a younger and weaker <br>
  enemy, something a tribal leader could never live down. Sweat slicked my palms, and I rubbed them <br>
  on my jeans. I thought it through quickly, if I wanted to suggest something extreme. I mean, <br>
  reverse the situation and Devlin would kill Breandan without hesitation.<br>
  Was his life Breandan's to claim? The fairy culture seemed deeply steeped in honor and tradition. <br>
  Lochlann was the rightful leader of the rebels, not Breandan. If he killed the tribal leader I <br>
  didn't know what it would mean. It could cause more damage to the fairy hierarchy than leaving him <br>
  alive would. My eyes travelled down to a puddle of my blood dripping in steady plunks to the floor. <br>
  I swayed, but before I staggered, I was in his arms.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="612" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“This is your own fault for not minding your own business,” Breandan said and looked down his <br>
  perfect nose at me. “Our shields were only conjured to protect. If they had triggers attached you <br>
  would be dead. Using magics on a whim is beyond irresponsible, Rae. It puts you in danger. You must <br>
  not go beyond your capabilities.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="613" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Tossing my head back in defiance was a bad idea, the forest rolled. “He was going to kill you,” I <br>
  said petulantly.<br>
  The look he shot me had me cowering in his arms. “Such little faith you have in your mate.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="614" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan glanced at Devlin, who was still frozen like stone; decided he was not</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="616" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">a threat and turned his back to set me down on a fallen log.<br>
  Devlin shifted, coming back to himself after the shock of losing. Pressing a hand to his temple <br>
  then threading his fingertips through his white-blonde hair, his hand kept travelling down until <br>
  it swept around his neck and chest. His eyes widened, went wild as they darted around the ground. <br>
  His gaze fell on me, and I met it with cool indifference. Swallowing at the look of expectation on <br>
  his face, I couldn't help but slide a hand over my pocket. Devlin followed my gaze and then <br>
  grinned.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="617" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He moved onto Breandan, “One would think you want to kill me, boy.” Smiling impishly, dimples <br>
  appeared on his cheeks.<br>
  Breandan growled; a low rumble that darkened his expression and heated my blood. A hiss seeped from <br>
  my parted lips, and I placed a hand on his stomach, scrunched my fingers together so my talons <br>
  pierced his skin. The pain was intentional to ground him. His hand slipped into mine as he regained <br>
  control.<br>
  “You will both pay for this,” Devlin said and smiled. “In ways you could never imagine.”<br>
  Breandan made a small noise, but remained still. The smile slid of Devlin's face and his eyes <br>
  narrowed.<br>
  “Breandan,” I began wearily. “What-”<br>
  He placed a finger in my lips. “Rae, go back to the Temple now.”<br>
  I blinked up at him. “But, why can't I stay? I want to go with you.” I spoke with his fingers on my <br>
  lips.<br>
  “I'm taking Devlin to the Grove.”<br>
  I breathed out slowly. “Okay, why can't I come to? After all I'm a fairy too. I should know where <br>
  this place is.” I lifted my chin defiantly. “I want to see it.”<br>
  Breandan risked turning his back on Devlin to grab me by the shoulders, lift me up and set me on my <br>
  feet. I could feel my face morphing to a sulky expression. He looked me in the eye. “I want to you <br>
  be introduced to the people with no distractions. Not tainted by his association. Do you <br>
  understand?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="618" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="619" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">After a pause I nodded. I could see his point. I would be a great point of interest if I turned up <br>
  looking like hell with Breandan dragging Devlin behind him. It was frustrating, because it felt <br>
  like he was keeping me in the shadows. But there was no logical reason for him to do that, so it <br>
  was just me, silly Rae overacting.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="620" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I'll go back,” I mumbled into my shoulder and half turned. “Watch yourself with him, okay?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="621" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan gave me a little shove. “Walk back and I will run. I'll be with you before you can miss <br>
  me.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="622" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin grinned at me. What was so funny? Did he know something I did not?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="623" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I shivered, and started off at a slow walk. I was not afraid in the blue and purple forest <br>
  surrounding me. It was peaceful. As I wandered back, I slid my glamour back on, and tugged at the <br>
  gaping hole at my back where my tee shirt had given way for my wings. The world became darker and <br>
  it felt like I was draped under a heavy curtain. My limbs dragged, and my hearing, sense of smell <br>
  became muted. How had I functioned like this for eighteen years? Finally alone, I took a moment to <br>
  think on everything that had happened to me. The day seemed endless, and I hoped there were no more <br>
  surprises in store. I didn't know how much more I could take. I was dying to pee, so I squatted <br>
  behind a tree and relived my self, humming low in my throat.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="624" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Back on the compound, I was reaching for Bayou's door when a heavy hand landed on my shoulder. The <br>
  hand was warm, human warm, and it spun me around and pressed me back into the door.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="625" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Lord Cleric,” I protested and pushed forward, but he held firm.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="626" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I was stronger than him of course, but I let him pin me to the door as the Lady Cleric from that <br>
  morning came out of the shadows. I dipped my head in a show of respect but my mind was racing. This <br>
  was not good. It was the middle of the night, I was not asleep in bed like the other Disciples, and <br>
  I looked like I had been to hell and back.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="627" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Hai, Disciple,” the Lady Cleric said in a nasal drawl.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="628" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">She had a slight accent and upward tilt to her eyes. She was a small thing, tiny hands and feet <br>
  obscured by mittens and clunky black boots. Her mousey brown</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="630" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">hair hung straight, severely parted in the centre and cut blunt at the ends, and over her eyebrows <br>
  in a fringe. She was not attractive, or ugly either she just looked mean.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="631" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Hai, Lady Cleric,” I replied.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="632" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I didn't know her name, so I simply said the honorific keeping my eyes downcast and my voice small <br>
  and quiet at an attempt at meekness, whilst I scrambled around my head to get my story straight. <br>
  This treatment of me was against the rules. This told me two things. One, that they suspected me to <br>
  be the girl in the forest that morning. Two, they had already tried the official route and had <br>
  probably been told to take a hike by the Priests. Oh gods. Or they were acting with Sect approval <br>
  and their orders where to take care of me quietly.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="633" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">And I'd handed myself to them on a platter.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="634" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Looks like you're doing some hard thinking there,” Tu said. “Why so nervous, Rae?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="635" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I looked my teacher in the eye, and could not hide the flash of hate in my glare. He faltered and <br>
  the pressure on my shoulder eased. I used it to slide away and stand up straight. I felt the wind <br>
  blow past and sent a chill up my exposed spine. How would I explain my ripped top? I lifted my chin <br>
  and looked between them.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="636" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Is there something I can help you with? I'm tired after my run, and I would like to sleep.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="637" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">They shot looks at each other. “Do you often run in the middle of the night?” The Lady Cleric <br>
  looked me up and down. “Looking sodisheveled?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="638" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I scrunched my fingers into fists behind my back. “Yes, Lady Cleric. I like to run at night. I find <br>
  it soothing.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="639" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Do you run in the morning?” Tu asked quietly.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="640" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I nodded my head. “Sure. The security guy often lets me out in the pre dawn. I circle the Temple <br>
  grounds and come back.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="641" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The Lady Cleric tilted her head. “Sounds innocent enough.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="642" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="643" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I smiled somewhat tightly. “Do you run, Cleric? If you do you will know how peaceful it can be.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="644" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Yes. I too find it soothing. Killing demons can be stressful.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="645" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I flinched, just a little, but enough to confirm their suspicions. Normal people did not flinch <br>
  at the mention of killing demons. It was seen as a good thing.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="646" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“We know all about your morning runs, Rae. But that's not why we are here. It's what led us to you, <br>
  but not why we're here.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="647" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I swallowed a couple of times before I could say. “I don't think I follow you. Led you to me?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="648" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You know there is an in and out list for the gate?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="649" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I closed my eyes briefly, realizing the blunder before I answered. “Yes, Lord Cleric.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="650" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“This morning, you went out as usual, but you didn't come through the gate again.” He pointed <br>
  behind him, where the black iron gates lurked. “You showed up in my class sure enough, and asked a <br>
  fewconcerning questions. When we came back to the class you looked most preoccupied. Then you <br>
  skipped all of your afternoon classes. Most concerning.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="651" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My hand reached behind me and curled around Bayou's door handle.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="652" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I understand Lord Cleric,” I said humbly. “I will come to your classroom tomorrow morning to <br>
  discuss my punishment.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="653" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The Lady Cleric's face twisted. “No, Disciple Wilder. You are coming with us. Now.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="654" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I jerked the door open and bolted through it. Taking the stairs two at a time a hand snagged my <br>
  ankle and I went down. I smacked my head on the stair in front of me, and was half dragged back <br>
  down by my calf. Flailing to grab the railing rushing by, I caught one and held on. I half turned, <br>
  and kicked with my other leg catching the Lady Cleric by the side of her head. She let me go and I <br>
  scrambled up the stairs on all fours. Up the second flight, I heard her close behind me and plucked <br>
  my key out of my back jean pocket. I heard her take the</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="655" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="656" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">second flight of stairs, cursing the gods as my hand tried to slot my key in the lock. My hand <br>
  trembled. As it slid in and clicked, I opened the door and turned to get the Lady Cleric's fist <br>
  straight square in the face. Pain exploded out from my nose and radiated across my cheekbones. I <br>
  flew back, and landed hard on my back with a flat thump. The Lady Cleric stepped in and kicked the <br>
  door closed behind her. Glamoured as human, I could see nothing in the dark, but I could hear her <br>
  raspy breaths.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="657" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I wiped at my bleeding nose. Why was it not healing?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="658" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Demon bitch,” she spat. “That's what you are, isn't it? A demon. That was the only way you evaded <br>
  the dogs, my tracking.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="659" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“It's not what you think,” I sobbed and crawled backward.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="660" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I knew it was you, but Tu wasn't sure. He tried to convince me it was just a coincidence. That one <br>
  of his precious students could never be one of them.” The venom in her voice made me tremble even <br>
  harder. “You disgust me, I read your file. You've been hiding among us since a baby. Fooling that <br>
  old Priest into thinking that you were an abandoned ward.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="661" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No, it wasn't like that.” My heart hurt when I thought of the Priest who had found me outside his <br>
  door. I would never do anything to hurt him. It was him who had suggested I be enrolled at Temple <br>
  when he saw how I had survived at the orphanage. I shook my head again. “It wasn't like that.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="662" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I was afraid. Had I been this afraid when I'd met Breandan? Or when I'd met-I swear, my heart <br>
  stopped then kicked twice before a cold sweat broke out on my palms. I couldn't even think his <br>
  name, because then it would be real. The horror of what was about to happen would become a reality, <br>
  and there would be no taking it back. I hobbled up and pressed myself against the wall.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="663" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Tomas,” I whispered.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="664" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I felt him shift beside me before I saw his silhouette slink forward. I heard his snarl a second <br>
  before I held my palms up and out, the words to call him off dying on my lips when I thought hard <br>
  about what she would do to me. Would she have taken me to the Priests for judgment, or would she <br>
  have killed me?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="665" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I watched. I watched him move silently around her, and watched as his fangs ran</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="666" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="667" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">out. She was still advancing toward me, hyped on hate, and unaware her own death was less than a <br>
  moment away. He grabbed her head, and clamped a hand over her mouth to smoother her scream. Yanking <br>
  her shoulder down, he curled his fingers around her cloak to rip it away and expose her flesh. His <br>
  head hung suspended against the smooth ivory of her neck, and I watched her eyes widen in horror. <br>
  Instant tears make them glisten as Tomas twitched then bit down. A spray of blood splashed against <br>
  the wall and my face. I was unable to look away. It was loud, grizzly and violent. The heels of <br>
  the Lady Cleric's boots thumped on the hardwood floor, and the salty smell of her blood filled the <br>
  air. Her dying wail was heard only by me as a senseless keen, a single sustained note. It lasted a <br>
  few seconds. It lasted an age. Then, when he was done, Tomas let her lifeless body fall to the <br>
  floor with a hollow thud.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="668" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It took me less than a moment to see the immense danger of my situation. I started to creep along <br>
  the wall, keeping myself as small as possible. Tomas stood in the middle of the room, savoring his <br>
  kill. Good for him, bad for me. I made it all the way to the door then the darkness swarmed around <br>
  me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="669" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Before I could squeal, Tomas had hold of my wrist and yanked me forward. I pulled against him, <br>
  again pressing myself into the door. I held still as his tongue swept over my skin, smoother than <br>
  a normal tongue. He lapped up the blood I'd wiped from my nose and groaned. He loomed over me, <br>
  brown eyes liquefying.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="670" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You smell like sunlight,” he said darkly.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="671" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His fingers brushed over my pulse point then his eyes flashed black. He bent my wrist back and I <br>
  cried out in pain.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="672" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You have to let me go,” I said and kept a tight rein on the urges of my nature.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="673" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Fear pressed on my mind made it hard to think. Made it hard to remember he was here to talk not <br>
  hurt me. This demon, this vampire who right now thirsted for my blood wanted to talk, and I'd left <br>
  him here for half the night, hungry.<br>
  He'd just sucked the life out of a Cleric, but it didn't seem to have been enough. She had been a <br>
  small thing. If I attacked it would be fatal, for he would succumb to his baser instinct.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="674" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Fangs still dripping with blood, my blood; his chest started to rise and fall rapidly.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="675" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="676" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Are you going to bite me, Tomas?” I did not snatch my hand away; it would excite rather than <br>
  subdue him. “You promised no biting and I trusted you. I trust you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="677" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I am what I am,” he said, slowly.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="678" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Bringing my wrist back to his mouth, his fangs grazed over a vein and the lush tearing of my skin <br>
  punctured the edgy silence. He made a noise half way between a growl and a pained keen.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="679" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Don't do this.” I tugged my hand, unable to help myself. His eyes heated. “If you don't let go-”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="680" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“What will you do?” His voice was dark, filled with anticipation. He pushed my sleeve further up my <br>
  arm to expose more of my skin. “I want to taste you. I have since the first moment I breathed your <br>
  scent.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="681" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">With a sigh of triumph, he opened his jaw wide, and bit down.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="682" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Squeezing my eyes shut, I felt my skin divide as his fangs sank into me. Gods, it hurt, it hurt. <br>
  His cold lips brushed my skin and it burned as he sucked. Then it changed. Subtly, the burning <br>
  started to sweep over me in tingly pulses of pleasure. My eyes flickered open and I moaned. A tide <br>
  of lust flowed through me and invaded secret places they had no business being. Thick blood gushed <br>
  down my hand and overflowed from his mouth, only for him to lap it up. A wave of fatigue had my <br>
  knees buckling.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="683" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Tomas,” I shouted and reached out to the well of energy now mine to control, all I had left to <br>
  defend myself with. I pushed power into my voice as I called his name and it boomed. It was loud, <br>
  and echoed through me, made the walls quake.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="684" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Head flying back, dark hair streaming across his face, he gasped and clutched a hand to his head. <br>
  He spun, dragging me with him like a rag doll and threw me across the room. Before my body hit the <br>
  floor, for a split second it was like I could fly. Had I been a clever girl, I would have dropped <br>
  my glamour and used my wings to land softly on the floor. I was too messed up to do anything but <br>
  cry. When I landed, I rolled and rolled before crashing into the base of the wall.<br>
  Thank the gods my room was small. Tomas staggered back and hit the wall on the opposite side. He <br>
  bent over, trembling and mumbling incoherently to himself.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="685" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="686" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Tomas,” I repeated, quieter this time.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="687" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I needed to know he was okay. If not I would need to run. I didn't want to fight him, so I would <br>
  run. He was by the door, but I had magic now and I knew how to use it. Not very well, I was likely <br>
  to create a fireball big enough to obliterate us both, but it would be better than being sucked <br>
  dry.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="688" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Wait,” he said hoarsely. His eyes cleared up and he fell to his knees. His hand reached out to me; <br>
  palm up and it shook. “I'm in control now. Wait.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="689" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I nodded and pressed myself into the wall. Tomas's vampire smell and the salty tang of my blood <br>
  filled my nostrils. Sweat trickled down my brow, and I focused on controlling my breathing as my <br>
  body repaired itself. Oh gods, thank you. My nose felt better already, as did the rest of my body. <br>
  When Tomas had tossed me my shoulder and left side had taken the brunt of the impact when I'd hit <br>
  the ground. I'd felt a rib or two crack. I was upset but strangely calm at the same time. Ana had <br>
  said a vampire would bite me and she had been right, of course she'd been right. Tomas was a <br>
  vampire, but I had held my own and taken care of myself. Yes, I had been thrown across a room and <br>
  used as a tasty post dinner beverage, but still.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="690" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">After a few beats he stood and crossed the space. He stopped a few paces shy of<br>
  me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="691" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I was hungry. You were supposed to be here at sunset. I could not leave without talking to you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="692" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I didn't have a choice.” I glared up at him, my fear becoming anger. “The fairies came back for me <br>
  during the day, what was I supposed to do? I tried.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="693" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“We had an agreement. You broke it.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="694" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“If I came back here before they had shown me what they needed to they would have found and killed <br>
  you,” I said harshly. “I wouldn't have been able to stop them.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="695" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Stop them?” There was a trace of surprise in his tone. His dark eyes narrowed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="696" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I met him stare for stare. “Like you said, we had an agreement. I promised to hear you out and a <br>
  safe dark place.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="697" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="698" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I saved your life and you repay me with disrespect.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="699" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I've kept my end of the deal. I'm here aren't I? I'm sorry I am late, but it was unavoidable and <br>
  y'know what, ditto. I saved your life too, you ungrateful ass. How long would you survive in the <br>
  sunlight against a fairy or two?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="700" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He was disquieted. I could tell this from the way his face and body became motionless. The pulsing <br>
  dark that surrounded him thickened, and it was like I could almost hear it humming. It extended in <br>
  curling wreathes and drifted forward to settle over me. It was not a restraining blanket of fear <br>
  this time, but gentle welcoming. We were silent for a long while, taking comfort in each other's <br>
  presence. It was strange. Now the dark had embraced me it was like I could perceive Tomas. He was <br>
  no longer a scary vampire-boy, but a boy who just happened to be more than human. The balance had <br>
  shifted between us, stepped into something unknown. Curling my wounded arm into my side, already <br>
  flaring up and healing, I pulled my sleeve down to cover my wrist.<br>
  Tomas helped me stand and straightened my clothes. I wiped at the blood smeared across his mouth, <br>
  looking at it made me queasy and if I saw him lick it up I may be forced to try running away again. <br>
  His skin was icy and slick.<br>
  “Breandan can never know,” I said and stepped away.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="701" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“This Breandan is who?” he asked curiously then stiffened. His voice was dark and angry, yet still, <br>
  it stroked me from the inside out. He stepped closer and sniffed at my hair. Then he dipped his <br>
  head and slid his mouth along the side of my neck, lips cold and smooth. “He is the fairy I smell <br>
  on you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="702" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“He'll kill you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="703" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I checked my forearm. It had healed and I fingered the two crescents now permanently scarring my <br>
  skin. Good thing I wore my hooded jumper with its sloppy sleeves like a second skin.</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="706" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Nothing. We would fight and one of us would die, of course.” He sounded as if it were a simple, <br>
  common thing. “And now we talk, the night calls to me.” I</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="708" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">waited silently, like a good girl, but he paused. Rather, he hesitated. “Rae-”<br>
  We locked eyes and the blackness enveloped me. There was no more space between us, nothing to stop <br>
  us coming together. He reached out, clasped my hip and pulled me into him. As my body molded to <br>
  his, his lips nudged my head back and he tangled his other hand in my hair. The scent of him was <br>
  inexplicably appealing. He still smelt like a vampire, but it was no longer repellent. He smelt <br>
  like Tomas, a blend of minerals and wet grass. His face was no longer shadowed and ugly but <br>
  mysterious and full of character. His skin was icy to touch. He teased my lips open with his, as my <br>
  teeth nipped his bottom lip. He growled, and I responded with ferocity to equal his. I stood on my <br>
  tip-toes to reach his mouth, press myself against him. Sliding his hands beneath my thighs he <br>
  hoisted me up and pushed me against the wall. It was then my glamour dropped and my wings spread <br>
  and curled down as I sought his mouth again. His cold tongue slipped between my lips and stroked <br>
  mine. Then his fangs ran out and sliced by bottom lip open. He jerked back, but it healed almost <br>
  instantly.<br>
  I ran my tongue over my lips and smirked. “I'm not as breakable as I look.” I said.<br>
  He chuckled darkly. I found myself not afraid, but intrigued and I licked the sharp tips of his <br>
  fangs. He groaned. Was it me? The feral and demanding girl with her legs locked round a <br>
  vampire-boy's waist, digging my hands into his shoulders, dragging him closer.<br>
  The kiss deepened and I clung onto him, one hand fisted in his hair and the other roving across the <br>
  nape of his neck. Tomas pushed forward, securing me into his solid frame, and ran his hands down my <br>
  sides. My skin was on fire, my blood boiling. He broke away to trail kisses down my neck then was <br>
  still, holding me. Both our chests heaved. I realized he was hot, hard and had his mouth at my <br>
  throat.<br>
  He swallowed loudly then slowly, deliberately kissed my wildly jumping pulse, and leaned away.<br>
  We locked eyes again. I figured the look of shock and confusion must have been mirrored on my face. <br>
  I so had no expected that. The biting, sure, that was bound to happen some time or another, but a <br>
  kiss that flooded every vein in my body with fire? When did that become a possibility? Oh gods, <br>
  what have I done?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="709" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="710" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“That was-”<br>
  “Different,” I said and swallowed.<br>
  “This is not normal, Rae. My kind and your kind do not mix.” His eyes travelled over my wings. He <br>
  did not look repulsed but intrigued.<br>
  “I didn't expect I mean, I'm sorry if I have upset you.” He reached out and stroked my wingtip. I <br>
  felt the caress down to my toes. “Oh,” I breathed.<br>
  He nuzzled me and whispered in my ear, “I am not upset.” “I'm glad because I...” I blushed. “I <br>
  liked it.”<br>
  “You feel good to me too, but what shall we do now?” My legs were still around his waist, and the <br>
  wall supported my back leaving his and my hands free. His wandered to the edge of my jumper, then <br>
  swiftly pulled it over my head.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="711" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My face felt hot. Never had I been kissed like that before. Or treated like this. Breandan had been <br>
  my first kiss and it had felt wonderful. But my second from this vampire had felt oh, it hadn't <br>
  felt as nice as what his hands where doing now. “That feels-” I sucked in a breath and my eyes fell <br>
  to the body of the Lady Cleric. All the blood left my face and my eyes twitched back to his.<br>
  “Good?” he finished for me and raised an eyebrow.<br>
  He raised his head to kiss my neck and I couldn't help it, I arced myself into<br>
  him.<br>
  There was a gush of air as the door crashed open. Splinters of woods flew like daggers and embedded <br>
  into the wall around us. Breandan thundered into the room and launched himself at Tomas, knocking <br>
  me to the side as he did so. They smashed through the wall and were lost to my sight.<br>
  I was curled into a small ball and reality was suspended. I found it hard to breathe right, my <br>
  chest still felt too tight from the emotions that had overwhelmed me during Tomas's embrace. I <br>
  waited but the hole in the wall remained, letting me see the night sky. I was feeling overwhelmed <br>
  but it helped centre me. It was all so much it made me step outside myself and take control. The <br>
  snarling, growling noises where getting louder. I rolled up, darted forward</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="713" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">and looked down, carefully leaning on a patch of wall that looked solid.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="714" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Tomas and Breandan rolled around in the grass like two fools, but two fools with dangerous weapons. <br>
  Breandan straddled Tomas, a shard of wood in his hand.<br>
  The tendons on his arm and neck were bulging, and the deadly point of the wood was a mere jerk away <br>
  from spearing Tomas in the chest. My vampire-boy was on red alert. He looked menacing with his <br>
  fangs fully on display and his eyes glazed black; nostril's flared. Snarling up a storm his mouth <br>
  snapped for Breandan's neck.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="715" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I grabbed my jumper off the floor and dropped through the hole. As I landed my already abused ankle <br>
  twisted, and I dropped like a stone. Why it had not healed?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="716" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My emotions were wide open, and wildness seeped from Breandan's nature to mine. It rubbed me up the <br>
  wrong way, and I found myself unable to stop the fight, because I was battling the more carnal of <br>
  my urges. It was telling me a threat, a vampire was close and to attack. The conflicting feelings <br>
  of hate and lust I felt for Tomas had my stomach in knots.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="717" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Calm down,” I said through my teeth, and staggered up. “Breandan, look at me.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="718" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He didn't look, but his ears twitched and I knew he was listening. First I was going to try and <br>
  talk him out of trying to stake my vampire then I was going to tear him apart.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="719" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I could hear voices around the corner. The noise of them busting through a brick wall had been loud <br>
  and messy. We had woken the building up and it was only a matter of time before confusion made way <br>
  for ruthless order. Three floors up there was a ragged hole in the side of my building leading into <br>
  my room. There was no way I'd even be able to hide it. It had demon stamped all over it. The <br>
  Clerics were going to piece it all together, and that would be it for me. The Clerics would come <br>
  and find us. In fact, Lord Cleric Tu was probably up there with the body of his dead partner. He <br>
  would know it was me in the forest. He would know somehow I had gotten demons past the Wall, and <br>
  into the Temple. All of this passed through my mind in less than the time it took me to glance up <br>
  at the hole then glare at Breandan, since he was still on Tomas like white on rice.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="720" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He turned his head to look at me, and his expression was wary. Damn right it should be. I was <br>
  beyond pissed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="721" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="722" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I should have known,” he said to me. “I smelt him on you, but I thought I was wrong.” I was going <br>
  to have to start taking many more showers if it was that easy to figure out who'd I'd been with by <br>
  a lingering smell. His eyes roamed the space, for he could hear the voices too then came back to <br>
  Tomas. “You are mine, not a dead things snack,” he hissed.<br>
  He hadn't seen the kiss. He thought Tomas was about to bite me. Well, I didn't know if I should <br>
  tell him he had it all wrong, or to leave it alone. Correcting him would bring up questions as to <br>
  why I was pressed up against the wall with the vampire-boy all in my space with his fangs out.<br>
  Tomas didn't say anything. He watched me. His gaze felt heavy and as I looked into his eyes I <br>
  whispered, “I want him alive.” Breandan made a short noise of impatience and I raised my voice. <br>
  “Get off him. Now.”<br>
  “I do not know what he has done to make you feel like you have to help him, but you must see he <br>
  is-”<br>
  “You killed her!”<br>
  I spun round at the anguished yell.<br>
  Cleric Tu was red in the face and it looked like he had been crying. He clutched a metal rod in his <br>
  hand. I remembered the drained body of the Lady Cleric and wondered how close they had been. Had <br>
  Tomas killed his love?<br>
  Breandan slid off Tomas and hauled him up with one arm, moving so fast they both blurred. Tomas and <br>
  Breandan stared at each other, not a foot away. Tomas looked pointedly at Tu and Breandan shook his <br>
  head.<br>
  “We have no choice,” Tomas said curtly. “He's seen her.”<br>
  My head swung between them, trying to figure it out what they were discussing. What choice was <br>
  there to make?<br>
  Cleric Tu lunged at Breandan. Tomas was suddenly beside me, snarling. Eyes pitch black and fanged <br>
  face scary as death, but he wasn't the reason fear gripped me hard and had the breath whooshing <br>
  from my lungs. Breandan was losing.<br>
  How such a thing was possible was beyond my comprehension, but his movement was slow and his <br>
  reactions sluggish. Each time the pole came near</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="723" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="724" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">him he shied away. Tu lunged forward again, thrusting with the rod at Breandan's torso. Instead of <br>
  a thump to the stomach the pole kept going, slicing through flesh, and burying itself in Breandan's <br>
  stomach. Silence. Tu let go of the pole and staggered back, face slack with shock.<br>
  Staring at the metal protruding from his body, Breandan went pale and said, “Oh no.” Then he <br>
  crumpled.<br>
  Tomas snarled, and stepped forward menacingly toward the Cleric, who jumped then legged it back <br>
  round the building.<br>
  I scrambled over to Breandan, and fell to my knees beside him. He was unconscious. I took a deep <br>
  breath and let my eyes roam down to collide with the stubby length of metal sticking out of his <br>
  abdomen. There was so much blood.<br>
  Body propped off the ground, the shard of metal had punched straight through him.<br>
  “Rae, we must leave.” Disorientated by intense dread, Tomas's freaky silent vampire movement made <br>
  me jump.<br>
  “Say-so,” I said. “We leave, but I have to help him first.”<br>
  “He is finished, I smell the iron.” He went to place a hand on my shoulder, but I ducked from <br>
  beneath his touch.<br>
  “No,” I said and bared my teeth at him in a snarl. He snarled back and it was a much more <br>
  impressive showing than mine. It shocked me out of it. I fixed my face, and pleaded for <br>
  understanding with my eyes instead. “I'm staying because, I can't I can't do this, Tomas. I cannot <br>
  leave or watch him-” My head swung from side to side jerkily. “We heal but it has to come out.”<br>
  Placing my hand on the metal rod the instant sting made me hiss. I snatched my hand back. Opening <br>
  my palm the flesh sizzled where glass had cut me open.<br>
  Huh?<br>
  A cool hand landed on my shoulder. “Listen to reason. I know you feel-” “You don't know shit,” I <br>
  screeched. “Help me. Help me, or get out my way.”<br>
  Gripping the pole again all my strength zapped away. What? I just didn't get it.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="725" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="726" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Was there an enchantment on it? The metal stung my hands until I had no choice but to release it. <br>
  Breandan's hot blood trickled from his body, seeped onto the ground in a growing puddle. Pooling <br>
  around knees, it soaked my jeans.<br>
  Tomas's shoulder shunted me to the side. “Give me room.”<br>
  Face grim, his fingers flitted over Breandan and his nostrils flared. His inch long fangs were <br>
  fully extended and dangerous looking, telling me he was still hyped up; bloodlusty, but his eyes <br>
  had cleared to deep brown. A nasty gash he'd gotten across his forehead when he'd crashed through <br>
  the wall had closed up to leave nothing but a smear of blood on his ashen skin. “He needs healing. <br>
  Heal him.”<br>
  “I don't know how.”<br>
  I pressed my hand onto Breandan's arm, needing to feel connected. His skin was cold. I squeezed, <br>
  but there was no response to comfort. How could he do this, leave me now I needed him? I didn't <br>
  know what to do. I had been too self- absorbed, and wrapped in my own problems to ask what I should <br>
  do if a situation like this ever occurred. What was I going to do without him? A fire built in my <br>
  belly. He had released all this power within me and now he was going to leave me?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="727" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You will not die,” I said fiercely, not sure why I reached to the Source as I said the words, <br>
  simply that I did.<br>
  It flowed into me like molten lava and wrapped around my heart. Hot pain shot up my arm from <br>
  Breandan into my stomach. Wavering on my knees, my head took flight as magic ran riot through my <br>
  body. With nowhere to channel it I locked it inside me. One hand clutched at my abdomen the other <br>
  kept its death grip on Breandan's arm; no way was I ever letting go of him.<br>
  “Are you hurt?” Tomas ran his eyes over my body. “We need to get away from here.”<br>
  “If you insist on saving this worthless fairy's life, I will have to carry him.”<br>
  I sank my teeth into my lip, thinking. Breandan would not be happy with this. “But where do we go? <br>
  I have nowhere else. This is my home, and I have no family, and no friends apart from Alex, who <br>
  lives here.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="728" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="729" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“We don't need to go anywhere in particular. Into the forest will do. You fairies are most powerful <br>
  there.”<br>
  He added nothing else to this impromptu plan prompting me to say, “Then what?”<br>
  “Hope you can learn to call to your kind, or hope they find us before he dies.” He picked Breandan <br>
  up and threw him over his shoulder. “Follow me, and don't fall behind.”<br>
  He ran and I followed behind, trying to keep pace. I was tired, and after less than a few minutes <br>
  started to slow. Tomas pressed a trying pace through the night.<br>
  Even when I did fall too far behind, he was easy to find. The metal pole pointed up and out like a <br>
  mast from Breandan's limp body. The hood of my now holey sweatshirt was up to shield against the <br>
  cold, but it flew off my head as Tomas jumped over the Temple wall and I followed. I didn't think <br>
  how impossible it was, I just did it, pushed off and soared over. Landing was loud affair with much <br>
  grunting and gasping. We reached the edge of the region and he stopped just before the buzzing red <br>
  wires of the Wall.<br>
  “We need an exit,” he said and looked at me.<br>
  I gasped for breath. I bent over to rest my hands on my knees. “I can't,” I sobbed. “I'm too <br>
  tired.”<br>
  He grabbed my arm and dragged me forward. Now he was mad. “This was your choice, I'm hungry, and I <br>
  carry this fairy for you.”<br>
  He shook me roughly then let me go.<br>
  I gritted my teeth and focused. My mouth was dry from nerves as I reached out and drew on the <br>
  Source. It flooded me, but I was not strong enough to control the energy eager to be free. I felt <br>
  something within me give, a thread snapping. I lost my concentration. The fence pinged and <br>
  unraveled, but the power whiplashed out to slice through a tree a few feet to my side. There was a <br>
  loud snap and groan. It toppled forward, and I was too shocked to do anything but stare at it.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="730" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Tomas grabbed my arm again and dragged me through the hole in the Wall as the tree smashed to the <br>
  ground. The boughs sizzled and sparked as they came into</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="731" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  contact with the electrically charged wires. The klaxon started to blare in the distance. Tomas <br>
  kept his grip on my arm and dragged me behind him, supporting all my weight when my feet failed me. <br>
  When I was well enough to continue on my own, I wriggled out of his grasp and he started to run <br>
  again.<br>
  Soon, we ghosted through a deserted city. Every street corner had me on edge, wary of every shadow <br>
  and noise. I had not walked a town beyond the Wall in my life, and I gazed at the derelict <br>
  buildings, disbelieving that humans once lived in such grand structures. One I will forever <br>
  remember was so magnificent; I strained my neck to see behind me as we passed. It was a <br>
  gargantuan clock tower, connected to a lengthy building. The glass windows had long been shattered <br>
  to nothing, but I imagined them whole, glinting in the sunlight. I had heard the stories of it, <br>
  the place near the river, where the rulers of this region used to meet. A great bell would chime <br>
  every hour to remind people of the time. After a while, it faded into the background and I turned <br>
  my attention back to my immediate surroundings. The streets looked like something from a <br>
  nightmare.<br>
  Blood stains; black from age, was smeared on the pavements and pooled where bodies used to lie. <br>
  Doors hung from hinges, windows were smashed and jagged pieces of glass littered the road. <br>
  Swarms of bloated rats scurried away as we passed, their black beady eyes reflecting the weak <br>
  moonlight. Burnt out cars were rusted and overturned, or abandoned on the roadside, doors still <br>
  open.<br>
  Trees sprouted from the buildings and knee high blade grass cut into our shins. Piles of rubble and <br>
  destruction blocking the way were easily jumped and climbed over. There were no bodies, just <br>
  crumbling brick and pitted stone and twisted metal.<br>
  Was this it? Was this the hell-hole in which we died? I remembered Ana's prediction then tossed my <br>
  head irritably. No, this wasn't it. Orchard was a fairy wyld not a deserted human city.<br>
  The situation was beyond crazy and all I could think was what next? If only I had gotten back <br>
  sooner. Tomas wouldn't have been so hungry and maybe Breandan would have paused before trying to <br>
  stake him. Pushing the hair out of my eyes, I sneezed at the dust floating down my fingers <br>
  dislodged. I had underestimated the Clerics and it was a mistake I would never make again.<br>
  We passed the city and Tomas stopped. I thanked the gods, for my legs were shaking with <br>
  exhaustion.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="732" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  “Rae,” Tomas said. “You will hear me now.”<br>
  I stared at him. “Do I really need to tell you know is not the time?”<br>
  Tomas lay Breandan down, rather gently all things considered. “Once you have called to the fairies <br>
  it might be too late.”<br>
  I was exasperated. “Why?”<br>
  “They may kill me before you can stop them. I must try to make you agree.”<br>
  I smacked myself upside the head. This was not going to be good. “You never said I would have to <br>
  agree to anything.”<br>
  “It is a choice you have to make.”<br>
  Time was of the essence here, but he was right. I had promised to hear him out, and calling <br>
  trigger-happy fairies in beforehand would not be so clever. I breathed out through my nose and <br>
  looked him in the eye.<br>
  “What the hell do you want from me?” “I'm dying,” he said.</p>

  It was a statement of a lifetime, and my mouth fell open.<br>
  “But, you're immortal,” I said, as if that would explain everything.<br>
  “We're dying, all vampires and we have been for a while. There are few of us left.” Sadness briefly <br>
  flitted across his face. “We're starving,” he told me. “The nest I belong to is small, but one <br>
  struggling to hold onto some form of dignity. Many of my kind have been reduced to senseless <br>
  cannibals who would just as likely drain another vampire as a human. They have fallen to the <br>
  madness of the dark.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="735" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">This was big. Huge. I didn't know how to begin to respond. I decided to be polite but frank.<br>
  “Tomas, I'm sad for you, but I don't see how this could have lead to you to me.” “You know vampires <br>
  used to be human.”<br>
  “No, you used to be pussycats.” I made a noise of frustration. “We don't have time for this.”<br>
  He held a pale palm up. “You listen, or I won't help you.”<br>
  Tomas had saved my life from the Lady Cleric. He had helped Breandan and me escape from the Temple <br>
  at a risk to himself. Surely I could hear him out like I promised. I mashed my fisted hands into my <br>
  side.<br>
  “Go on,” I huffed, bad naturedly.<br>
  “We used to be human, but changed and became vampire. We are not infectious. I cannot turn you; I <br>
  am what I am because of genetics. Just like shifters are born human then discover the ability to <br>
  change form, we too are born human and change at some significant point in our lives.”<br>
  “You mean, you're not dead?”<br>
  He did one of those fast and annoyed movements with his hand. “Yes. My</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="737" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">human body died.”<br>
  That explained a lot. “Oh, well, um sorry about that.” It was an awkward moment for me, though <br>
  Tomas seemed at ease. I talked over it, “But that does not explain why you're dying.”<br>
  “What do we eat?” “Blood.”<br>
  “Yes. Where do we get blood?”<br>
  I tapped my foot and rolled my eyes. He was leading me somewhere and was opting for the prolonged <br>
  and dramatic route instead of spitting it out. “You drink from humans.”<br>
  “Where do the survivors of the humankind live?”<br>
  I stared at him like he was dumb. “Uh, behind the Wall-”<br>
  It hit me between the eyes like a flying brick. Vampirekind had lost their food source. During the <br>
  Rupture the demons, vampires in particular, had all but made humans extinct. Now they were paying <br>
  the price for the humans had locked themselves away from the rest of the world.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="738" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You see,” he said. “We are starving. Some humans are gifted in magics and become witches. There <br>

  nest I was born into, gifted with the Sight. She saw you in my future, though she never said <br>
  anything about the blood we have shared. You are the key to my survival.” He touched a cold hand to <br>
  my lips. “Rae, you will save me.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="739" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Oh gods. I opened my mouth then closed it again. I forgot what he was and prodded him in the chest. <br>

  I have to tell you is important.”<br>
  “Well yeah, but I figured you were going to spew some vampire crap about some bad vampire hurting <br>
  lots of good vampires, and that maybe you wanted me to get the fairies to help. I didn't realize <br>
  it would be something as huge as saving your life. The gods damn it, Tomas.”<br>
  “What will you do now?”<br>
  “Figure out how to call a fairy to come fix Breandan.”<br>
  “Good idea. He does not have much time left.” He sounded positively happy at the idea. I glowered <br>
  at him at he smiled. It was not a beautiful smile, but one of charm and my lip twitched. “Will you <br>
  call to someone in particular?”<br>
  I thought about it. “I've only met one other fairy and he knew loads. Breandan trusts him. He'll <br>
  have to do.”<br>
  I closed my eyes. Time passed and nothing happened. I rubbed my temples and resisted the urge to <br>
  hum.<br>
  Tomas sniffed the air. “No magic?”<br>
  I shifted on the spot then sat down. Folding my legs beneath me I closed my eyes again. “I haven't <br>
  touched the Source yet. I wascentering myself.”<br>
  Lie, lie, lie. I was trying to figure out what the hell to do next, because I had no clue what I <br>
  was doing. After a few minutes I still had done nothing. I didn't want to call on the Source <br>
  because I didn't know what to do with it, and I didn't want to make anything bad happen. There was <br>
  no conscious fairy nearby to fix my mistakes. Urgh.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="742" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Tomas sat behind me and pulled me onto his lap. I stiffened and my eyes opened. He reclined against <br>
  a tree, pulling me with him.<br>
  “You need to calm down,” he said. I looked over at Breandan, who rested so still a few paces away. <br>
  I could barely hear him breathe, and I was expected to be calm? Tomas placed both hands either side <br>
  of my face. They were cold, and felt wonderful against my warm cheeks. He sighed. “Relax, and do <br>
  what you need to</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="743" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="744" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">CIO."</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="745" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">With no more time to lose, I closed my eyes and gasped as pure, blistering energy filled me the <br>
  instant I reached to the Source. I was learning intense anger or fear helped to focus my mind. I <br>
  drifted from my body, and sought out the memory I instinctively knew would help me find Conall. <br>
  Suddenly he was there, aware of me and I locked onto the tenor of his mind like a homing beacon. I <br>
  reached my hand to touch.<br>
  “Conall,” I said and he whirled round. “Conall,” I called louder. The energy felt like a thrashing <br>
  rope, crackling and fighting my control. “I need you, can you feel where I am? Find me.”<br>
  Exhausted, I sobbed and snapped back into my own mind. I slouched backward and the forest canopy <br>
  swung into view. Tomas caught me and rested me on the leaf-strewn floor next to him.<br>
  “Did it work?” he asked close to my ear. “Keep your eyes open, Rae. Did it work?”<br>
  Sighing, I didn't have the energy to shrug. “I'm tired,” I said. “Rest then. I will watch over <br>
  you.”<br>
  I stared up at him. His face was already so dear to me. How could that be? He was not my kind; he <br>
  wasn't’ even human. Vampires were cold and deadly, and Tomas would have probably killed me if he <br>
  had crossed my path in any other circumstance. What would I do when Breandan woke? Did I tell him <br>
  about the kiss that set my heart on fire? Did I tell him the darkness that enveloped Tomas was now <br>
  my darkness to? I sighed.<br>
  Maybe it would be best if I closed my eyes and never opened them again. Life was too complicated. I <br>
  felt strongly for Breandan. When I was with him here was no one else. But it was the same with <br>
  Tomas. Oh gods what was I going to do?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="746" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Then pain sliced through everything. Breandan was getting worse, much worse. Gulping air, I focused <br>
  on the shiny space in front of me rather than how difficult it was to breathe. My heart pumped hard <br>
  and tried to punch through my chest. I clutched at it and squeezed, hoping the pressure would help. <br>
  It sped up. There</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="747" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="748" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">was a distant keening in my ears. It tasted like someone had just shoved a fist full of metal into <br>
  my mouth. Faint, but growing louder was sound of my heartbeat. My vision blinkered, and my heart <br>
  slowed enough to feel comfortable. A cloying numbness seeped through my limbs, and the darkness <br>
  hovering at the edge of my vision looked inviting, sweet. I turned to embrace it and float within <br>
  its cool nothingness.<br>
  Someone dragged me backward, away from the painless dark to the murky surface of consciousness. I <br>
  felt irritation. Who was taking me away from the peace of the dark? A low buzzing grew louder and <br>
  louder, until I could distinguish words. My eyes flickered open. Tomas had my head clasped in his <br>
  hands, and his eyes were focused on mine. His hands, clothes and skin were soaked in blood. Of <br>
  course, only he would drag me back from bliss to painful reality.<br>
  “You are bleeding,” he said. “But there is no wound. It seeps through your skin.”<br>
  I was startled to see my top pushed up to expose my midriff. Blood gushed to the ground in a dark <br>
  puddle beneath me. My blood, the source of the gushing blood was me. I went to speak, but the <br>
  metallic taste of blood silenced me. Should there be so much in my mouth? Looking down the body I <br>
  once saw as strong, I could barely move. In the low glow of the moonlight from above, my skin was <br>
  pale. My tail limply flickered on the ground, and my wings were spread and crumpled, they fluttered <br>
  uselessly at my sides. I doubted it was a good look for me.<br>
  “You're still hungry,” I said practically. Tomas's dark eyes bored into mine. “I am fine.”<br>
  “You said you were hungry, and it's just going to waste. You need to be strong and quick in case <br>
  Conall doesn't listen. Just don't bite me, okay.”<br>
  After a few moments, I giggled. I was dying and there was a vampire licking blood of my stomach. <br>
  Tomas stopped, and his blood smeared face peered at me with interest. The world blurred at the <br>
  edges. My lungs forced me to suck in air in shallow pants, but they couldn't fill.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="749" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A faint buzzing drew my attention. “that is enough for me,” Tomas said and leaned forward, slowly, <br>
  to brush his mouth against mine. His tongue licked over</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="750" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="751" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">my lips and they parted. He tasted salty, like blood.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="752" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I tried to smile, to show that I liked him kissing me, but it was lopsided and brief. “I'll b-bet <br>
  you never had this in mind when you came t-to find me. So far, all I've done is g-get you into <br>
  t-t-trouble.” I shivered and felt goose bumps pop up all over me. Tomas frowned then shifted away, <br>
  and started to rub my arms and legs. His hands moved so fast they blurred.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="753" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">After a while, when I stopped shaking, he stopped and pulled me closer. He touched my ears and <br>
  grinned, all toothy. “I find I want you to live, Rae. I want-”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="754" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A fierce roar brought my head swinging round to see a giant rushing forward, sword unsheathed and <br>
  glinting in the moonlight. He weaved through the trees like a ghostly phantom, and was heading <br>
  straight for us. Another phantom was close behind him, Conall. His own weapon was drawn and he <br>
  leaped forward with a guttural cry when his eyes locked on Tomas. The world slowed to a torturous <br>
  pace.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="755" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My throat was on fire but I breathed a faint, “No.” Just in time before the pressure of my emotions <br>
  heightening caused more pain, and my voice cut off.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="756" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Slamming to a stop, Conall's demeanor switched from death incarnate to wary so quickly, I wondered <br>
  if I'd started hallucinating. My vampire-boy crouched in front of me and snarled so fiercely I was <br>
  afraid to place my hand on him as I staggered up, and draped myself over him.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="757" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Not him,” I mumbled. “He helped me.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="758" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Tomas's hands were scrunched into claws, and his body was statue still with either fear or rage. He <br>
  shuffled back and kept me with him. To get to Tomas, the fairy-man would have to either hurt me, or <br>
  haul me out the way. His sword swung high. It looked like he was opting for decapitation.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="759" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall cried out, “Not her.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="760" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The giant halted to complete stillness, and his sword arm dropped. He breathed in deeply, and his <br>
  face smoothed from a snarl into a composed mask of cool indifference. “Peace,” he said, voice <br>
  booming and clutched his sword at the ready.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="761" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="762" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The pointed ears and radiant features named the giant as a fairy-man. A magnificent mane of blonde <br>
  of his hair rippled down to his bare shoulders and his face was hard and strong. Most arresting was <br>
  that he had one blue eye and one green eye. He made a short, commanding noise at Conall, who bowed <br>
  his head meekly. Then he headed straight for Breandan, and knelt down to touch his chest. His brow <br>
  furrowed and he murmured something too quietly for me to hear. He stopped halfway and turned his <br>
  head to fix his blue eye on me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="763" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I shrank away from the steely glare, for some reason ashamed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="764" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Tomas was tightly wound. Fangs fully extended, eyes glazed over black and nostrils flared. So large <br>
  and dark were his eyes they made his skin paler, absorbing the moonlight to radiate outwards. It <br>
  was peculiar to see an immortal react with such fear. If you didn't have a stake around the only <br>
  other thing that could kill a vampire was fire. Or decapitation, but that worked on pretty much <br>
  every being.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="765" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Swallowing the bitter taste at the back of my throat, I ignored nausea in the pit off my stomach. <br>
  My eyes scanned Conall's face, looking for the kindly fairy I knew within this monstrous warrior. <br>
  Incomprehension was followed by anger at his expression. His eyes flicked across Tomas with <br>
  distaste, and in them I saw death. His searching eyes met mine and his face filled with pain.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="766" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Conall,” I said softly. My knees trembled. “You came. You heard me.” He sheathed his sword in one <br>
  fluid motion and rushed to my side.<br>
  Tomas disentangled himself and stepped away from me. The darkness that surrounded him, and me, <br>
  wobbled then retreated. Suddenly he was no longer so accessible to me. The familiarity was gone, <br>
  but there was something still tying me to him, a poignant memory of the dark.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="767" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall narrowed his eyes to slits and looked at the space surrounding me. Could he see the <br>
  darkness? Mouth pulled into a grim line he eased me onto the floor and tried to make me <br>
  comfortable, gently moving my wings. I gritted my teeth at the sharp forks of pain that shot down <br>
  my right pinion. My body was battered and I was not healing.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="768" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“What has happened here?” he asked and eyed Tomas with distaste.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="769" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  “I wish I knew. I did something with magic and I can't say it was one of my brighter ideas. It <br>
  hurts like hell.”<br>
  He stared at me hard. Then he snorted. “You have shared your life with Breandan, but you are not <br>
  strong enough to sustain it.”<br>
  I had? I nodded weakly and my attention shifted to what the fairy-man was doing with my fairy-boy. <br>
  He winced at the pole and gingerly avoided touching it.<br>
  “It is iron,” he rumbled.<br>
  “Who are you?” I asked. When he did not answer, the corners of my mouth pulled down but with no <br>
  time to go into the specifics of good manners, I turned to Conall, “We don't like iron?”<br>
  “It drains our strength and is poison to us. It burns.” He paused and made a small waving gesture <br>
  with his hand, as if brushing off an errant thought. “There are stories of iron-working fairies, <br>
  but such a one is rare. I have never met one in my lifetime.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="770" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I remembered how weak I had felt when I touched it, how all my energy had drained away. Then I <br>
  remembered the sizzling of flesh when Cleric Tu had cut Maeve's face. Iron drained our strength, <br>
  and burned us when it touched an open wound. How quickly would we die if it was to be stabbed into <br>
  us, and was there any other material that affected us so? I shuddered for the thought was hideous.<br>
  “I want you to be honest with me, I'm not too late? I mean, you can save Breandan?”<br>
  He nodded, hesitantly. “I will try, but I do not think you will like me for being able to soon.” He <br>
  smiled. “I did not teach you to call to another, you taught yourself?”<br>
  I grinned back at him, proud. “All I need was to be calm and focused.” My eyes darted to Tomas. I <br>
  could not have done it without him.<br>
  The world blacked out, a scary thing to happen with your eyes wide open, blood pooling around you <br>
  and your failing heartbeat thumping in your ears. A sweep of cold brought me to. Tomas's hand was <br>
  leaving my forehead.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="771" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="772" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall smacked his hand away. Hissed. “Watch yourself,” he said.<br>
  Tomas tried to touch me again with the same result. “Touch me again and you'll lose that hand, <br>
  fairy,” he growled and rolled onto his haunches.<br>
  I couldn't bear it if they started fighting. The importance of the moment held fast I opened my <br>
  mouth. “Please stop.”<br>
  All eyes snapped to my face.<br>
  The fairy-man stood, and lifted his chin at Conall, before glaring at me again. I took in the hard <br>
  angles of his face, and the blue eye that held the warmth of a glacier, not that the green was <br>
  anymore soothing. The proud set of his mouth, the shape of his jaw was so familiar I could reach <br>
  out, close my eyes and map the dimensions.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="773" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You should not be here,” Conall said to Tomas and firmly pressed down on my chest wound. I barely <br>
  felt the pressure of his hand.<br>
  The numbness was back, a light, seeping sensation that flowed steadily over me.<br>
  “I would rather face the sun then watch what is about to happen, but I cannot leave.”<br>
  My mouth dried up. Sweat beaded my brow and ran down my temples. “What shouldn't he see?” I asked <br>
  Conall in a small voice.<br>
  “Are you sure you wish for me to do this?” he asked the fairy-man, ignoring me.<br>
  He sniffed and crossed his arms across his bared chest. The muscles in his arms rippled. “You are <br>
  better at healing than I. I want him whole so I can tear him apart myself.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="774" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall fell silent, the corner of his mouth curving up. Kneeling between Breandan and I, holding a <br>
  hand over each our brows and chanted something rhythmic and urgent. The life in the forest was <br>
  suspended. I sensed it was going to happen, that big pain that made you sick just to think of it. I <br>
  was feeling everything Breandan felt. I'd bound my body to him and now I was dying alongside him. <br>
  They were going to pull the iron pole out of Breandan and it was going to hurt. A lot. He was <br>
  unconscious. I was not.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="775" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  “Don't let them,” I whispered.<br>
  Tomas could hear me, of course, but he was focused hard on the middle distance. I tried to yank on <br>
  his arm but my fingers merely brushed his skin.<br>
  He looked down at me. His eyes burned against his stark white skin. “It'll only hurt for a little <br>
  while,” he said.<br>
  I stared at him. He was not going to help me.<br>
  “Take your hands off me. Let me go right now.” I wiggled with renewed vigor fed by fear, and all I <br>
  could do is kick the air. “Please don't hurt me anymore.”<br>
  Tomas's heavy hands held my shoulders down.<br>
  The fairy-man gripped the iron pole. My stomach dropped and my heart leaped into my throat. I felt <br>
  the blood drain from my head.<br>
  I screamed, “Don't!”<br>
  He cried out something harshly as he yanked the iron from Breandan's chest. My torso jerked <br>
  violently. My eyes bulged and tried to escape their sockets. Stomach squeezing into nothing every <br>
  muscle in my body clenched. My insides<br>
  wrenched, and my heart just - stopped. Tomas held my thrashing body by the shoulders, pushing me <br>
  down onto the damp, mossy floor. Conall spun round, took Breandan's head in both hands and roared. <br>
  The sound was deep, vex and violent. Breandan's back contorted, arced off the floor. Writhing in <br>
  agony a silent screech of pain deformed his expression. He convulsed then became languid.<br>
  Conall slumped, pressing his head on the ground.<br>
  The pain released me, and the absence of hurt was stark. I curled into a ball. Peering into Tomas's <br>
  face, remarkably, my thoughts were clear and focused. I had survived the ordeal and it had felt <br>
  like the end. What would have happened to Breandan?<br>
  “The next words coming out of your mouth need to be telling me he's okay,” I said.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="776" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="777" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He glanced over her shoulder. There was a beat where he stilled and everything around me <br>
  disintegrated but then, he breathed out and nodded. “He lives,” he said and slid back.<br>
  I craned my neck to see around him, and for a moment all I could see was the broad back of the <br>
  fairy-man, huddled over and blocking Breandan from my sight. Hissing in anger, I surged onto all <br>
  fours. And then he shifted to the side, holding Breandan by the arm. He said something close to <br>
  Breandan's ear, and my fairy-boy started, looked around wildly before our gazes locked.<br>
  I crawled forward, the effort sweetly painful. The closer I got the brighter his skin glowed. I <br>
  sprung up, stumbled, and slid on a branch. Legs wobbling my tail twitched madly. The glow of <br>
  Breandan's skin increased. He sat on his knees swaying; opening out his arms his face brimmed with <br>
  emotion as I fell into them. The moment he clutched me I pressed my eyes closed at the brilliant <br>
  light that blasted from our joined bodies, and the power that flowed through me was hot and eager. <br>
  It flared, rubbing at my nature until I found myself digging my fingers into Breandan's back for <br>
  fear it would sweep me away.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="778" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A startled yell echoed into the trees, and a flock of nesting birds took off into the sky. The <br>
  energy drained, the light cut off and it was dark. I opened my eyes, and as my vision corrected <br>
  itself I blinked to help it along.<br>
  My gaze travelled down to see someone sprawled on the floor. Tomas, whorls of sweet smelling smoke <br>
  emanated rising from his body, was face up and motionless. I jerked from Breandan's grip and <br>
  crawled toward him. Opening his eyes he groaned. I stopped, wary. Lightening patches on his ivory <br>
  skin healed as he jumped up and wobbled unsteadily. He scowled, plainly troubled at his own lack of <br>
  dexterity. He saw me, half reaching out to him and half holding back.<br>
  “I'll need to feed again,” he said quietly.<br>
  My heart back flipped in my chest. I had a flash of memory, his fangs sinking into my flesh and <br>
  shivered.<br>
  “Then do not let us keep you,” said the fairy-man before I could answer.<br>
  Tomas's gaze twitched from mine, and he bowed his head in a show of respect. “The girl and I have <br>
  personal business to attend to,” he said with more than a hint of ownership in his voice. “I cannot <br>
  leave.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="779" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="780" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The fairy-man returned the gesture though his mouth pressed into a thin line and a vein in his neck <br>
  bulged. “Whatever debt she owes you for your help will be paid. You have my word, but you cannot <br>
  come where we are to go.”<br>
  I studied his face and wondered who he was. Clearly he was an oath-sworn rebel, to have come with <br>
  Conall. He couldn't be older than his mid twenties in human years, making him ancient as a fairy. <br>
  He felt dangerous, vicious. In comparison Conall's presence was timid.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="781" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You know boy-vampire,” he continued. “When a fairy speaks it can only speak the truth.”<br>
  I blinked at that. I'd lied out of my ass a thousand times before.<br>
  “Yes, I know this. Just as I know Rae will do her best to return to me.”<br>
  I felt my face flush and my heart thump too hard. He was standing up for me, and I liked that he <br>
  had such a high opinion.<br>
  Breandan tipped my face to his and peered at me. I avoided his eyes. “Let's go,” he said. He <br>
  released me and stood, slowly, nodding his head at<br>
  Conall to say thank you. The fairies drifted a few paces away then waited for me.<br>
  Tomas and I stared at each other. We had been through so much together in so short a time. To be <br>
  parted from him would hurt me, I was sure of it.<br>
  He saw my confusion. “Go with your kind,” he said.<br>
  I stood, and rubbed my hands on my thighs. I avoided looking at him. “Where will you go?”<br>
  “Back to my nest.”<br>
  “Uh, you'll be okay? I mean, you'll make it back there with no problems? I'd hate for anything <br>
  toit's just I don't like the idea of ” Gods, it was pathetic. Why could I not just spit it out?<br>
  He stepped closer. “You owe me,” he said in a low voice.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="782" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="783" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I'll see you again, and pay my debt. I promise.” A bird screeched nearby and I looked to the east. <br>
  I frowned, worried. The sky was getting much lighter. “You'll need to find a dark place.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="784" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He reached for my hand. “A safe place.” “Rae,” Breandan called. “Come now.”<br>
  Tomas stopped reaching for my hand, and instead leaned forward to whisper into my ear, “I'll find <br>
  you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="785" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He blended into the shadows and was gone. There was a peculiar feeling on my mouth. I pressed my <br>
  hand to my lips and they were cold, plumping back up as if they had given under pressure.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="786" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">When I turned round, Conall beckoned to me with a grin, and took off behind the fairy-man. Breandan <br>
  waited for me then we ran too. My thoughts lingered on Tomas. Our goodbye had felt wrong. <br>
  Incomplete.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="787" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan ran for a long time without saying a word and that was fine by me. He kept sneaking looks <br>
  my way. Opening then closing his mouth. Sighing. He said, “Will you explain why I feel a connection <br>
   between you and the vampire?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="788" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No,” I said simply. “It's separate, from us and not something I can discuss with you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="789" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He didn't like that. He darted in front of me and pushed me back by the shoulder. It was not meant <br>
  to hurt me, or knock me down, but in his anger he went to far. I tried to swing the force from <br>
  falling to my advantage, and roll back up, but I was not nearly skilled enough. I hit the floor <br>
  face first, and spat a leaf out of my mouth. Huh. Looked like we were going to have it out right <br>
  there and then. I had wanted to give him some time, since he'd only just been brought back from the <br>
  brink of death, but clearly he had something to get off his chest. Getting annoyed at his <br>
  high-handedness would get me nowhere. We'd been here before too, him pulling and chucking me around <br>
  like I was unbreakable.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="790" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I stood up and faced him. “What do you remember?” I asked shortly. “After the explosion what do <br>
  you remember?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="791" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He paused, eyes far away. A spasm rippled across his features as his eyes flicked</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="792" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="793" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">to me. “There was pain in my stomach and my strength was gone. The pain was from iron.” He <br>
  shuddered. “I heard you call to me but I could not answer then there was darkness.”<br>
  “That's it?”<br>
  “Then, there was more pain. Mine and yours.” His eyes sparked anger. “You shared all you are to <br>
  keep me alive. Do not do it again.”<br>
  “No,” I said and looked him in the eye. “I know my own mind, I can-”<br>
  “-take care of myself,” he finished. He sighed and looked away, eyes becoming unfocused. His brows <br>
  mashed together. I didn't like how it scrunched his eyes and smoothed out the furrows. “Conall <br>
  healed me,” he continued. “It was unpleasant. Then there was only you. You glowed like the sun.” <br>
  His face had taken on a look of awe.<br>
  I shook my head; worried he got it wrong. “Not me,” I corrected. “You glowed, not me.”<br>
  His eyes softened. “Trust me, your light is like no other. I woke to find you whole. Close to me.”<br>
  He smiled and I blinked. His teeth were sharper than normal teeth, fang-like. Even shown in a smile <br>
  they were scary. I ran my tongue around my mouth and corrected myself. Our teeth were fang-like.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="794" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You want me to fill in the blanks?” He nodded. I thought about how best to break everything to <br>
  him. “You want the good or the bad first?”<br>
  “I am aware the vampire has fed from you.” His jaw was tight with distaste. “He attacked you?”<br>
  My anger had cooled down some, and I hesitated. I took my worry out on my bottom lip. “Tomas saved <br>
  me,” I said slowly, knowing his pride was going to swell and shatter the peace. “He saved you.<br>
  He stiffened. “No.”<br>
  “You owe him your life.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="795" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="796" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I owe that scavenger nothing.”<br>
  “You're not thinking clearly. You're seeing things warped by jealousy.” “Jealousy.” His face was <br>
  incredulous. “I am not jealous of that-”<br>
  I put my hands over my ears. “Don't.”<br>
  His body quaked with repressed anger as he struggled to contain his reaction. “You and I are <br>
  bonded. Do you understand what that means?” Teeth clamped together his words sounded short and <br>
  punchy.<br>
  “Yes, and I accept it.”<br>
  “Then how could you do this?” He roared. “You hid the monster the we tried to protect you from, the <br>
  monster that killed my sister.”<br>
  Eyes wide, I shook my head. “No,” I said and sucked in a breath. “Breandan, you can't blame him for <br>
  something he had no part in.”<br>
  “His scent was all over the forest. We found a pool of Maeve's blood and nothing else makes sense.”<br>
  He needed to know the truth. If not he would hunt Tomas, and I couldn't have that.<br>
  “I never lied to you, but I never told you the truth,” I said and swallowed hard. “I'm not good, <br>
  y'know, and I never pretended to be. Maeve,” I said, coming round to the point. “She's dead and I <br>
  watched her die.” The words tumbled into the empty air and hung heavy. Remnants of confusion <br>
  drained from Breandan's face, leaving a mask of pure horror, and the expression was horrible to <br>
  see. I cast my gaze down to the floor. “This morning, when you found me, I was running from the <br>
  Clerics that killed her. I found them torturing her. She saw me, even in the dark and she told me <br>
  to run.” Evidence of my pain streamed down my cheeks and ran into my mouth. “It's my fault. They <br>
  shot her, and it's my fault.”<br>
  “No. My fault.” He scrapped a hand over his face, eyes burning. “Maeve was there because I was <br>
  obsessed with keeping you safe. She was too young for such a charge, to guard you, but she is so <br>
  stubborn and persistent and I-”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="797" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="798" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His face crumpled, his body was racked with a sob. “I'm sorry,” I said and reached to touch him.<br>
  He flinched so hard it shocked me to still. Growling darkly, he backed away from me. The silence <br>
  stretched on and on and on, and I thought I would drown in the hurt in his eyes</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="799" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I scrubbed at my cheeks. “Please,” I whispered. “Please, understand why I couldn't tell you. I was <br>
  afraid. You were this strange demon and I was lost. You were showing me the way back to safety. If <br>
  I told you what had happened you know you would have done something regrettable.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="800" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His fingers curled into claws and a wild look twisted his face. “You knew how I worried, and you <br>
  knew she was my sister. You, said, nothing.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="801" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I opened my mouth to say something, anything, to explain but there were no words. What I had done <br>
  was selfish and cruel. I was a coward. I reached out to him again and he knocked my hand away. He <br>
  paced before striding up to me and clamping his hands down on my arms. He stared into my face and <br>
  squeezed me until I thought my bones would break. Instinct took over. I pulled my lips back to bare <br>
  my teeth as a hiss rumbled out of my throat. I held my ground until his face fell into some <br>
  semblance of human again. Storm clouds rolled in Breandan's eyes and lighting flashed in mine, but <br>
  then the desire to fight him drained. I was left empty. His eyes widened, realizing his grip was <br>
  hurting me, and he dropped my arms as if contact with me would infect him.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="802" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You break my heart,” he said and clenched his fists, looking up at the dark tree canopy. He took a <br>
  series of short, sharp breaths, and when he looked at me he was composed. “We don't have time to <br>
  waste bickering. Let's go.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="803" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I want to talk. To explain.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="804" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He turned away. “Must you fight me on everything?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="805" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Now you understand that Tomas had nothing to do with it. He helped me, carried you to safety. When <br>
  I thought you were-” I couldn't say it. The memory was too horrible and cast a shadow over the joy <br>
  of having him safe, with me. “I was a mess and I couldn't think straight. Don't you see we both <br>
  would have died without him? He pulled me together.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="806" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="807" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“And before then, when you first met him? You knew I hunted him.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="808" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I shrugged helplessly. “I did the only thing I could. A vampire cornered me and told me he was not <br>
  going to kill me, but wanted to talk. I was terrified, and he behaved so well before I knew it I <br>
  was agreeing to hide him.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="809" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Apart from a tightening of the eyes he was calm. “There is more.” It was a simple statement of <br>
  fact. “He did not feed from you the first time you met. I would have known it.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="810" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My face pinched in preparation and my eyes welled with repressed worry. “You'll be mad.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="811" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His were impatient. “I need to know, to decide how to act.” His finger tapped my chin up. “Tell <br>
  me.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="812" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“He needs my help.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="813" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He held my eyes, disapproval stamped across his features. “This relationship you have with him, it <br>
  cannot last. Our kinds do not mix.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="814" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“How did you know?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="815" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He looked away and sighed. “It was obvious that he cared for you. Such a creature of darkness could <br>
  not feel such a thing without it being returned.” His face became blank and his eyes blazed. “I <br>
  will kill him if he dares to touch you ever again.” His eyes gentled. “Come, we can go now to the <br>
  Grove. You wanted to go.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="816" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Breandan”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="817" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He remained silent but his grip on my chin tightened.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="818" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My foolishness pricked like thorns. “Have you never done anything stupid for someone you-”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="819" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He chuckled. “What? Love?” With a snort, he released my chin to brush his fingers along my <br>
  collarbone. His mood swings didn't surprise me anymore, so I smiled up at him tentatively. “You <br>
  should know something. Devlin was right about you being part of the Tribe. In the eyes of fairy <br>
  law, my claim on you does</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="820" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="821" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">not have to be honored unless you swear fealty to my brother. Because our union is not lawful our <br>
  bond is weak. What you feel for the vampire is the result of this. When our bond is sealed any <br>
  feeling for him will be overwhelmed by your love for me.” He grimaced. “Will you swear fealty to <br>
  my brother? Was he kind to you?”<br>
  My mouth dropped as I remembered the proud face so familiar yet strange to me. If Breandan's raw <br>
  energy and beauty were refined, and hardened the result would be Lochlann, Breandan's older brother <br>
  and leader of the rebels had returned. And what did he come back to? His brother in company with a <br>
  vampire and the silly fairy he'd bonded to practicing dangerous magic, after nearly destroying his <br>
  rebellion. And I had wondered what his problem with me was.<br>
  Breandan shifted and looked apologetic. “He can be over protective at times.”<br>
  The air in my throat caught. “He came back. I-I have to be honest, I didn't expect him to, did <br>
  you?”<br>
  “Oh yes.” He covered my hand, holding it to his face and a dark smile played on his lips. “He was <br>
  not happy when he learned of our connection, but do not worry, he will accept us. I will make it <br>
  so. We have the amulet of wisdom and that will please him, even if he does not show it.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="822" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I laid my hand over my pendant and grimaced. Breandan thought I was going to be handing it over. He <br>
  thought wrong.<br>
  A rash excitement was lighting Breandan's eyes up. “Are you ready to begin your new life? I have so <br>
  much to show you.”<br>
  I sucked in a deep breath, my chest puffing out. “Don't you dare think because you're all gorgeous <br>
  and perfect I'll start following you around and doing everything you say because I'm mated to you. <br>
  I won't hide behind you like a love struck fool every time there's a fight. I want to learn magic, <br>
  how other fairies fight and how to defend what's mine. And don't think I won't question you and <br>
  Lochlann's logic because, I got news for you-”<br>
  His hand tugged my chin forward. “Stop talking.”<br>
  I became still as he closed the distance between us. “Breandan,” I said his name as his lips <br>
  silenced mine.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="823" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="824" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He kissed me, slow and gentle. Then he was grabbing at my hips and biting my lip. When he pulled <br>
  away my lids were cast to half-mast and my lips bruised.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="825" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Oh,” I said and whimpered as he smirked, tugged on my arm.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="826" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">We ran again, and I could not stop smiling. Then when I stopped I was in the Grove and I positively <br>
  beamed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="827" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It was nothing special, the same trees of the forest and the same star speckled sky. I stepped <br>
  forward and nearly walked into a side of roasted pig hung high from a tree. What made me smile was <br>
  the fairy-children dressed in knee length tunics, swinging from hammocks, and slumbering <br>
  peacefully. Snuggled into their mother's side. I peeked at a few and cooed at their rosy cheeks and <br>
  soft crowns of hair. Many of the fairy-women were dressed in heavy fabrics, jeans, jumpers and <br>
  thick plaid shirts. The popular hairstyle of choice seemed to be up in a sloppy bun. Well I'd fit <br>
  right in. The men slept below on the floors under their women in coarse blankets. To the back there <br>
  was a large tent. A fire crackled and popped outside it. The Grove looked like any other campsite, <br>
  but the campers had pointed ears and glowed with an inner light.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="828" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The smile slid from my face as Conall stepped into my path.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="829" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No,” I said and stomped my foot. “No, because I just got here and I am tired and dirty and grumpy. <br>
  So no.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="830" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His small smile was apologetic. “Lochlann wants to speak to you.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="831" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Later,” I gritted through my teeth. “I need some sleep and something to eat, if you wouldn't mind. <br>
  Is there somewhere I could wash up?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="832" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Lochlann wants to see you,” he repeated.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="833" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I snorted and looked at Breandan for back up. My heart sunk. “We can't go sleep, can we?” He shook <br>
  his head. “We have to go see your brother right now, don't we?” He nodded. I sighed and made a <br>
  ‘move it along’ motion with my hands. “Lead the way, Conall. The sooner we get this done, the <br>
  sooner I can sleep.</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="835" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  Fingers entwined and shoulder's brushing as we walked, Breandan and I entered Lochlann's tent and <br>
  stopped in the centre.<br>
  He paced the paced in front of us, eyes narrowed and chest heaving. “Finally, you are here, and I <br>
  can begin judgment. Did you get lost on your way here?”<br>
  Breandan did not answer. Clearly, the question was rhetoric.<br>
  I however had something to say, “What do you mean, judgment?”<br>
  “You will not speak unless spoken to.” Lochlann's voice cracked like a whip.<br>
  It took a beat for me to recover from the shock of being told pipe down so rudely. “Who to the gods <br>
  do you think you're talking to? I'm not one of your rebels. You can't talk to me that way, or boss <br>
  me about and expect me to obey.”<br>
  He stopped pacing and looked deliberately from my face, to my fingers wrapped around Breandan's. <br>
  “My younger brother is sworn to me. Your attachment to him makes you part of my court.”<br>
  “Like hell it does,” I fired back. “What Breandan and I do is none of your business.”<br>
  Lochlann had intimidated me when I'd first met him, but not anymore. Two people had tried to kill <br>
  me. I was pissed, tired, had a full bladder, an empty stomach and he was making it worse. It was <br>
  hard for me to keep a semblance of calm when Breandan had only just been healed, and I had been <br>
  parted from my vampire-boy. He was pushing all the wrong buttons at the wrong time.<br>
  Lochlann seethed at me silently for a moment before his face went blank. Instead of relaxing I put <br>
  up all my mental guards; I was used to this behavior. Breandan did it when he planned to manipulate <br>
  me.<br>
  My eyes wandered and landed on Conall who smiled encouragingly. I managed a tight grimace in <br>
  return.<br>
  Lochlann held out his hand. “The amulet of wisdom, give it to me.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="836" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="837" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No,” I said.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="838" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He blinked and frowned. “I want to see it. You can have it back.” “I said no.”<br>
  He watched me for a while then said, “You saw my sister before she was taken captive?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="839" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Killed,” I said slowly and carefully. “I saw Maeve as Clerics killed her.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="840" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He pressed his eyes shut, cocked his head then shook it. “I feel her. She is alive. I would know <br>
  the moment of my sibling's death.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="841" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan nodded in agreement. “She is still with us. Hidden and bound by iron.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="842" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">That was news to me, and why hadn't he said so before. I knew fairies had amazing powers of <br>
  recovery, but could we survive a bullet to the chest? Maeve had looked pretty dead to me. I didn't <br>
  say this, of course, out of respect.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="843" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“The humans have gone too far this time. They will pay. My sister will be retuned. We will give <br>
  them one chance to free her, or we shall take her back by force.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="844" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I didn't like where this was heading.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="845" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Hold on. You can't be so general in your damnation, and you can't start throwing around <br>
  ultimatums.” Breandan squeezed my hand, hard and I shot him a look. “Don't be trying to silence <br>
  me. There are good people at the Temple. Yes, Lord Cleric Tu and the Lady Cleric were wrong, but <br>
  not all humans think like them.” I kept it to myself that a fair portion did.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="846" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“We did not start this.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="847" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You should defuse the situation, not rile it up. I'm telling you if you march up to the Wall and <br>

  <p class = "para1" id="850" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Lochlann, I think it's great you care about your family, but hurting people in their name-”<br>
  “You cannot talk to me of family.”<br>
  He really knew how to use words to effect. “Fine. I admit from what I've heard my roots leave <br>
  something to be desired.” I took in a breath, things were getting a little close to home, but I'd <br>
  started this and I was going to finish it. “But we're not talking about me. We're talking about <br>
  your actions that may start a war. The last time the demons and humans clashed, the entire human <br>
  race was nearly wiped out. I've been told that many of demonkind were not happy to fight.<br>
  What'll happen to the human survivors who face demons motivated to kill. We'd be looking at the <br>
  extinction of an entire species.”<br>
  “These Clerics. You would be able to show them to me?”<br>
  My lips twisted. Lochlann was not listening to me; in fact he was completely ignoring me. If the <br>
  fairies took this stance it would only end in bloodshed. The thought of my fellow Disciples <br>
  clashing with these beings made me sweat. “If revenge is what you're thinking, you're too late,” I <br>
  told him. “The Lady Cleric was killed by-” I stopped and slid my gaze Breandan's way. His only <br>
  reaction to the topic was a flaring of his nostrils. “She's dead,” I said flatly.<br>
  “The vampire,” Breandan explained through clenched teeth.<br>
  Lochlann paced in front of us, his eyes on me. There was little warmth there. “Brother,” he said in <br>
  a tone of quiet command. “Your, female has shown no respect for who and what we are. How do you <br>
  know she can be trusted?”<br>
  “Rae is true to me.”<br>
  “She kept the truth from you, on more than one occasion. Because of her you nearly lost your life. <br>
  And this thing with the vampire-”<br>
  “Is none of your business,” Conall cut in scathingly.<br>
  Lochlann barely glanced his way. “Your family is the single greatest disappointment to our race. As <br>
  the Elder you should be helping her to along her new path, not encouraging her foolishness.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="851" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  “Elder?” I asked.<br>
  “Head of the family,” Breandan told me.<br>
  Conall stared at Lochlann with thinly veiled hate. There was a niggle in my mind, two dots dancing <br>
  around each other waiting to be connected. Elder, head of the family, gold eyes.<br>
  “She is mine, Lochlann. Let me leave with her, and I swear you a month of peace.”<br>
  Breandan blanched.<br>
  I spun round and glared at the newcomer. When I saw who it was I managed to splutter, “What did you <br>
  just say?”<br>
  “I wasn't speaking to you,” Devlin said and let the tent flap drop behind him. “I was addressing <br>
  the one you refuse to follow.”<br>
  “I did not say I would not follow him,” I objected hotly.<br>
  I had remembered too late that not following Lochlann, meant I was in Devlin's Tribe.<br>
  “You're not seriously considering” I trailed off at the look on Lochlann's face. It was blank, <br>
  calculating. Cold.<br>
  Sucking a series of shallow gasps I slowly looked at Breandan's face, terrified at what I would <br>
  find there. He glared at his brother so balefully I was surprised the older fairy could withstand <br>
  the weight of it.<br>
  “One month with no attacks?” Lochlann asked.<br>
  Devlin made a big show of lifting his chin, and placing his hand over his heart. “I swear it.”<br>
  Uttering the oath the air thickened with magic and hung, waiting for acceptance. “No.”<br>
  The word was not shouted, or hollered or uttered in any way that could be</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="853" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">conceived as emotional. It was a flat out refusal, brooked no argument. It was a command. The magic <br>
  sighed and dissipated. Breandan slid me behind him and I wrapped my arms around his waist. I <br>
  couldn't stop my body trembling.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="854" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Do not deny the reason of it,” Lochlann said. “I said no.”<br>
  “This isn't just about you,” Devlin said. “You would continue the death of fairy lives for the sake <br>
  of one female.” He made a scoffing noise and ran his eyes all over me disdainfully. “She is <br>
  beautiful, and pure though she reeks of another. I promise you take her once and she will lose her <br>
  appeal.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="855" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“That is enough,” Conall barked. We all turned to him as he lithely stepped over to stand beside <br>
  Breandan. “This isn't even a discussion.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="856" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Who are you to interfere?” Devlin sneered. “You know very well,” he hissed back.<br>
  “Well then would someone mind letting me know?” I asked in a low voice. “Because I am mighty <br>
  confused.”<br>
  Breandan shifted and put his arm around me. “It is not the right time.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="857" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I shrugged his arm off and ignored him. I ignored everyone, but Conall. I tapped him on the <br>
  shoulder and he turned, reluctantly, to look down at me from his lofty height. His eyes, deep gold, <br>
  shimmered with suppressed feeling. When we had first met he had told me he knew me as a baby. Truth <br>
  rung inside my head and in a rush my thought's tumbled over one another, fighting for recognition.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="858" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall's eyes were a unique colour I had only seen on one other person. He had touched me, several <br>
  times, and I had never thought anything of it. When he had it wasn't like Breandan, whose touches <br>
  felt like fire and ice. His touches felt natural and comforting, and he'd never shown aversion to <br>
  touching me; even areas sacrosanct like my tail. Conall had watched over me and shown a level of <br>
  understanding a stranger would not have deserved. He had the same skin, eye and hair colour, for <br>
  gods sake.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="859" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Brother,” I said with certainty. “You're my brother.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="860" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="861" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He nodded once. “I had hoped when you finally visited Orchard, the place of our birth I could <br>
  explain your origin, our connection. I had hoped to get to know you and for you to learn to trust <br>
  me. Things have not worked out like I planned.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="862" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I was dumbfounded. I was dirty and tired and drained. Too emotional to try and explain how I felt, <br>
  I simply said, “Later. We'll talk later.” It was anti-climatic but he didn't seem to mind.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="863" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Yes, that would benice.” He paused. “Would you like to know the first time I ever laid eyes on <br>
  you?” Eyes wide, I nodded wordlessly and he beamed a smile. He was positively delighted by my <br>
  acceptance. He stood straighter and his eyes sparkled. “When you were born and I was a young one, <br>
  hours after your birth I peeked in your cradle. I tried to touch your cheek, but you fisted your <br>
  tiny hand around my finger,” he held his forefinger up, “and refused to let go. You puffed up your <br>
  chest and held your breath, so fearsome and brave. Mother called you, her little warrior.” He <br>
  laughed before his eyes became sad, haunted. “I did not mean to let you go. It was not Understand <br>
  when our mother took you” His face was pained, pleading. “I searched for you, for years, but the <br>
  spell on you was so strong. We only found you because you chose to venture beyond the Wall and <br>
  become entangled with Breandan's future.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="864" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Large, warn hands slid around my waist. I leaned back, needing the support. Turning round to look <br>
  at him, Breandan saw the worry in my eyes. He kissed my nose.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="865" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“It will pass,” he said softly.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="866" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I knew he meant the pain, the sharp stabbing pain of feeling the years of abandonment issues coming <br>
  to the forefront.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="867" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Taking a deep breath, I straightened my back and glared at Devlin. Before, I had denied him with a <br>
  few words, and I was sure it would work again. I was learning there were rules to how the fairies <br>
  operated. Devlin was walking around without chains, and I guessed that was because he had been <br>
  defeated and captured fairly, meaning he could not leave unless he was saved by his own people or <br>
  set free.<br>
  Honor and magic bound to follow the rules. “I'm going nowhere with you,” I said.<br>
  The words were backed by the rules of magic. They had weight and the tension</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="868" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="869" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">in the room cranked down a notch. Lochlann made a noise of annoyance. I fought the urge to run over <br>
  and stick my tongue out at him.<br>
  “That settles that,” Conall said diplomatically. “For now,” Devlin replied.<br>
  He and Lochlann shared a long, loaded glance. We all caught the look, who wouldn't, but I could not <br>
  care less. They could plot and scheme all they wanted. Devlin would never get my bonded mate to <br>
  agree with his brother and I would never say the words they wanted me to.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="870" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan squeezed me before letting go to stand before Lochlann. “Swear to me you will not consider <br>
  this again.”<br>
  Gazes locked they stood still and silent for a long time.<br>
  “You ask me to give up the chance for time to seek a peaceful solution?” “It will not allow it.”<br>
  “You are sworn to me, little brother.”<br>
  Breandan had an intense look of concentration on his face. He was deciding something and for less <br>
  than a beat, I felt apprehension. I had lied to him, kept secrets and aided his enemies. I had <br>
  refused to listen to him, and caused him a whole heap of problems with his family and lord. Oh <br>
  gods. Maybe he was thinking I was more trouble than worth. He had said himself our bond was not <br>
  sealed because of my connection with Tomas, and the fact our union had be created, but not sealed <br>
  by magic.<br>
  “Release me from my oath,” he said.<br>
  Lochlann stiffened, his eyes snapped to me and blazed with loathing. “You let her destroy your <br>
  honor.” Lochlann placed a hand on Breandan's shoulder and shook him. “She makes you weak.”<br>
  “We could break the bond,” Devlin said. “She has a blood tie to another.” Breandan's jaw worked. <br>
  “That is irrelevant. It would not work.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="871" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="872" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You are so certain,” he said with a small smile. “Hearts can change, and hers is already split in <br>
  two. How do you know she will choose you?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="873" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I raised my hands and let them fall to my sides. He just couldn't help himself. What I had done <br>
  with Tomas was none of their damned business. I refused to lower myself and defend something that <br>
  should not need defending. Yes, it was weird and strange, but I was getting sick and tired of being <br>
  discussed and talked about as if I wasn't even there.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="874" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I glared daggers at him.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="875" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I belong to her,” Breandan said simply. “And she you?”<br>
  “Now you all listen to me.” I took in a breath and set my feet apart. “I won't lie, I do care for <br>
  Tomas deeply. I don't know why or how such a thing is possible and I do not know how long it will <br>
  last.” I walked up to Breandan and pressed my fingers to his face. “I can't promise I’111ove you <br>
  forever, because I honestly don't know how I feel. You need to give me time. I don't know what will <br>
  happen next, but I'll never betray you. If you trust me, I'll trust you. Deal?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="876" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His fingers curled around mine and held them to him. Pulling me closer, he wrapped his arms around <br>
  me and crushed me to him.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="877" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Do it,” he fired above my head. “Breandan, I release you from you oath.”<br>
  There was a crack and Breandan staggered. I held onto him, and fell with him as his knees gave out. <br>
  Limbs tangled we hit the floor hard. Air became a physical thing and wrapped around my throat. It <br>
  settled then faded. Breandan trembled in my arms, head burrowed into my shoulder.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="878" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Everybody get out,” I said. The fairies had not moved they were still, shocked. “Lochlann,” <br>
  Conall said quietly. “Please.”<br>
  The fairy-lord scowled at my brother then turned on his heel and left. “Devlin, I wish to speak to <br>
  you about the human.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="879" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="880" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Laying my head down I didn't see them all leave, but heard and felt it when we were finally alone.<br>
  “You didn't have to do that,” I said. “He was wrong.”<br>
  We were quiet for a long time, and I thought hard on the reality of what was going to happen next. <br>
  Breandan was in a precarious position. He had broken away from his brother and the Tribe, making <br>
  him an outcast fairy. I had denied both Lochlann and Devlin that made me an outcast too. Devlin <br>
  knew I had the amulets of power and wisdom, but Breandan and Lochlann had no idea.<br>
  Gods, it was complicated.<br>
  There was something worrying me. The other guardian must have been Conall, he had the amulet of <br>
  protection, but that was not the one Devlin had. Had the Tribe really managed to steal it? Or did <br>
  Breandan jump to conclusions again as it seemed he was prone to do.<br>
  “Breandan, the amulet of protection, when did it go missing?”<br>
  He snorted. “For all that has just happened, that is your main concern?” “Can't you just answer the <br>
  question?”<br>
  He sighed, rubbed his head against my arm. “This morning. When I knew you needed me, I hid it so I <br>
  wouldn't risk losing it. It was a place I'd hidden my secret things since childhood.”<br>
  “How would a tribal fairy have found it then?”<br>
  He shrugged. “Maybe they cast a spell or followed me.”<br>
  It didn't add up. I spoke my next words carefully, mindful of his pride that could swell into <br>
  something nasty. “Don't you think that's not enough to base your whole theory on?”<br>
  Breandan shifted to look into my face. His eyes were sparkly and his cheeks had regained some <br>
  colour. “You know something,” he said. I nodded, and pulled the</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="881" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="882" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">two amulet pieces out from under my tee shirt. Breandan stared at them. “I should probably be <br>
  surprised, but I think the impossible will be possible with you around. His forehead furrowed. <br>
  “Wisdom and power.” He touched the last empty place in the centre of the amulet. “But where is the <br>
  amulet of protection you took from Devlin?”<br>
  “I took the amulet of power from Devlin.” I shuddered at the memory of the power boiling my blood, <br>
  and stroking a darkness lurking beneath the core of who I was.<br>
  “Then where is the amulet of protection?”<br>
  “That's why I think you were too hasty to blame the Tribe. I don't think Devlin has it.”<br>
  “Perhaps you are right, though I can think of no one else who would have the inclination to take <br>
  it. Its power can only work for one fairy.”<br>
  We had waded into dangerous territory again. It seemed all fairies believed they had a purpose, and <br>
  I was slowly coming to terms with what mine was, but I was not ready to openly talk about it.<br>
  I traced the outline of one of his tattoos. “Tell me what they mean.” “We all have a purpose. Mine <br>
  is to keep order.”<br>
  I giggled. “Really? You've done nothing but break the rules since you met me.”<br>
  He winced. “The tattoos signify my skills and accomplishments. Some are for protection. Others <br>
  guide me and help me see the truth.” He paused thoughtfully, slid a considering look my way that <br>
  held an undercurrent of something else. “You have asked me a question, now may I ask you one you <br>
  will answer?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="883" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Shifting on the floor that was quickly growing cold, I curled into a ball at his side and thought <br>
  about it. For a while there was only the sound of our breathing and the warmth of him. My eyes felt <br>
  all droopy, and my mind slid into a lazy sleep pattern.<br>
  “Well, that depends on the question,” I said sleepily.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="884" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="885" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Tomas.”<br>
  My lids slammed wide open. Breandan didn't sound angry, but mildly disgusted. “A name is not a <br>
  question, and I've already explained this to you as best I can.<br>
  Leave it alone.”<br>
  He snorted. “He will come back and I want you to stay away from him.”<br>
  I hissed my disapproval. He ran a finger down the bridge of my nose, over my lips. I kept my face <br>
  set, refusing to be distracted.<br>
  “He is vampire. It is not natural the way they are. They bring death wherever they go,” he said <br>
  with as much heat as an ice cube.<br>
  I thought back to the strange urge I got when I was around Tomas. It made me shudder. I could not <br>
  deny he felt unnatural to me, but it didn't mean it was right. Breandan was quiet for a long time, <br>
  and eventually I knew he was not going to speak again. I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep <br>
  right then and there.<br>
  I dreamed I was dying. I watched my last sunset and Breandan held me close. We raced were-cats <br>
  through the forest and the sun shined from within us. The moon rose and Breandan handed me to <br>
  Tomas, who cried tears of blood and showed me dark things. He fed from me and called me his love.<br>
  It was the cold hand clamped over my mouth and pulsing dark that woke me. “Wake,” a voice whispered <br>
  in my ear.<br>
  I peeked an eye open, remaining still. I kept my breathing even and glanced at Breandan's face. <br>
  Eyes closed and brow relaxed his breath came steady and even. I blinked up at Tomas. Had my dream <br>
  called him to me? He took his hand away from my mouth and pressed a finger to his lips, then looked <br>
  at Breandan. I got the message loud and clear. Stay quiet. I carefully shifted away from Breandan, <br>
  rolling to my hands and knees I crawled backwards.<br>
  I stood up and smiled at my vampire-boy. I was happy to see him. Tomas led me out of the tent, and <br>
  I shivered in the cold. It was quiet and everyone was sleeping, as you generally do in the middle <br>
  of the night. Tomas took my hand and led me away into the trees. I tugged on his hand to get him to <br>
  stop when I</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="888" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“What are you doing here,” I said in a low voice. “I thought you'd gone back to your nest.”</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="890" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My heart rolled over in my chest. “Why? I mean, do you have something else to say?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="891" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Trouble comes.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="892" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“What kind?” I asked sharply. “The kind where I get beat up or the kind where I die?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="893" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“In the last few hours the fairies have been negotiating the release of a human- girl. The ones <br>
  that follow the white haired fairy have taken a human from the Temple. They are trying to trade her <br>

  attack.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="894" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“When did this happen?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="895" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“As you, and the fairy who was supposed to be protecting you, slept. The night is fading, but we <br>

  <p class = "para1" id="896" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I didn't respond. It took me moments to make up my mind, but considerably longer to work up the <br>

  could.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="897" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Tomas read the look on my face. “Now is not the time to be selfless. This will vicious.”</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="899" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“He won't go against his brother and you know it.” He took my hand again. “Now we leave.”</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="902" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall stepped out of the shadows, his mane of hair wild and bristling. His breathing was hard and <br>
  he hummed with tension.<br>
  I thought I could smell his fear.<br>
  “Because they hoped your connection with his brother would sway his mind.” His chest had a shallow <br>
  gash from his breastbone to the opposite end of his ribcage.<br>
  “You're hurt,” I pointed at the slash in case he missed it. “Why are you not healing?”<br>
  He rubbed at it dismissively. “My energy is diverted elsewhere. Our bodies focus on the greatest <br>
  threat to our being. I am tired so my energy is saved to keep me quick and strong.”<br>
  “Who did they take?” I asked, curious.<br>
  There was a wail in the far distance and an answer came a moment later.<br>
  A silky hiss that followed from Tomas slithered up my spine. “How long do we have?” he demanded. <br>
  His hand slipped from mine, and I took it as a signal to stay put.<br>
  “I killed a scout moments ago. I was the messenger sent to the Tribe to decline the offer. They are <br>
  to sacrifice the human under a full moon, a perfect tithe and war cry. The peace Lochlann is <br>
  fighting for will be impossible. Devlin is trying to create confusion and fear and it will work.” <br>
  Conall looked at me. “Rae, we're going to lose,” he said. “You need to leave. Do you have your <br>
  amulet?”<br>
  I placed a protective hand over it. “Whatever is coming we can face it together. I'm not going to <br>
  hide. We have to go wake Breandan up.”<br>
  Conall stared at me. “What?”<br>
  “You have to escape. Your friend is lost.”<br>
  The words rocked my world and not in a good way. I blinked slowly, breaking</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="904" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">the stalemate, yet my body held its rigid pose. My clenched fists relaxed. I forgot all about <br>
  amulets and crazy fairies fighting each other.<br>
  “Who have they taken from the Temple?”<br>
  “If you die here there is no hope. Devlin would want you alive but his consort, she knows about <br>
  your bond to Breandan. To her you are a threat to her life mate, and she will not be merciful if <br>
  she catches you. Running into the midst of powerful enemies is no place for a fledgling soldier. <br>
  You are strong.” Pride flashed across Conall's face. “But this you must entrust to me. I will get <br>
  Lochlann and Breandan out safely.”<br>
  I knew, of course. I knew who the tribal fairies had taken to try and influence Lochlann through <br>
  me. Just like I had known the last pure fairy, and Priestess was my mother. Just like I had known <br>
  Conall was my brother. There was only one human I would risk everything for.<br>
  “Who have they taken,” I repeated.<br>
  “Skin the colour of coca and hair like the sun,” he said and wrinkled his nose. “Blonde.”<br>
  There was a hitch in my breathing. Alex. They had my best friend. How, I didn't know, but she had <br>
  been taken because of me. At what point did I condemn her to this fate? The first time I went <br>
  beyond the Wall. The first touch between Breandan and I, or was it when I refused to give Devlin <br>
  what he wanted? Devlin, he must have told them who she was and where to find her. He'd seemed <br>
  mighty interested in her all of a sudden. He had even touched her with fingers infused with light.<br>
  He had marked her.<br>
  “This ritual what will they do to her?”<br>
  “They will tie her down to revel in her flesh. Slit her throat and drink the blood.”<br>
  Everything became painful. The realization I was about to lose my friend made the air filling my <br>
  lungs feel heavy. I tried to imagine her bound and tortured, but my mind shied from the image. My <br>
  throat closed up.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="905" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="906" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You heard the fairy,” Tomas said. “They are going to lose. We must go.”<br>
  The pressure of the day's issues, and all the decisions I had not made weighed down on me. “Wait,” <br>
  I said and tried to figure out the right action. There was nothing but panic and fear. “I can't <br>
  think straight.” I pressed my fingers onto my eye sockets to relive some pressure. “I need a <br>
  minute.”<br>
  “The longer we wait the greater risk Wasp will catch you.”<br>
  Someone shouted behind us, and a flash of light in the distance lit the trees.<br>
  Conall darted away. “Take her,” he yelled over his shoulder at Tomas then was lost to my sight.<br>
  Before he could stop me, I turned and raced back the way we came. I was faster than him now I'd had <br>
  a chance to sleep. My vampire-boy had two choices, leave or follow. He chose to follow. We broke <br>
  into the clearing and it was chaos.<br>
  Fairies wrestled each other to the ground, hissing and snarling. The shouts were everywhere.<br>
  I raced back into the tent but Breandan was gone.<br>
  The women and children walked through the camp terrified, but unharmed. They were surrounded by a <br>
  handful of fairy-men who cut down any tribal fairy that got too close.<br>
  Which way did I go? I tried to feel through the bond but only got a vague impression that Breandan <br>
  was close. My panic kept throwing my concentration and I couldn't pin down a direction.<br>
  “Calm it down girl,” I told myself. “Now is not the time to fall apart.”<br>
  I breathed in and out several times to steady my thought. He was close, so close and in front of <br>
  me? My eyes popped open and I searched through the dark. I spotted him in the middle of the fray <br>
  back to back with Lochlann, fighting Devlin and Wasp.<br>
  She had come for her life-mate.<br>
  Conall skidded to a stop in front of me with a face of thunder. “Will you never</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="907" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="908" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">listen,” he hissed and threw me at Tomas. “I told you to take her. “We have to help them,” I <br>
  shouted. “Breand-!”<br>
  Conall clamped a hand over my mouth. He shoved me toward Tomas. “Make yourself useful and get her <br>
  out-”<br>
  A knife to his throat had him stopping mid flow. Wasp smiled and jerked her head.<br>
  “Come this way. Easy now,” she said sharply when Conall reached for the sword pommel on his hip. “A <br>
  little nick with this blade and your legacy ends. It would be a shame Conall.” Her eyes twitched to <br>
  me. “So much fuss over Sorcha's daughter and you seem less than nothing to me. You remind me of <br>
  her, the last Priestess. She was less than nothing too.” Her eyes settled on Tomas. “Though even <br>
  she wouldn't lower herself to the base level you're scraping. Come now, our lord waits.”<br>
  When I didn't move she dug the blade deeper into Conall's neck and drew a thin line of blood. I <br>
  glared at her and started to walk, Tomas close behind me.<br>
  Lochlann stood beside Devlin. Breandan was held at knife-point by two fairies that looked vaguely <br>
  familiar. It was the grey beard and copper Mohawk from the day before. The wind whipped my hair <br>
  into my face as my eyes locked with my fairy-boys.<br>
  His body jolted and his hands flew to his chest. Pain, sharp and hot at the back of my neck. I <br>
  touched the spot and felt something cold, thin and knobby. A twig?<br>
  My eyes drifted down. Breandan yanked a stubby twig out of his chest, pointed and tipped with <br>
  something that gleamed wetly in the low light. He reached for me as he keeled over face first. My <br>
  own legs weakened and crumpled.<br>
  I could hear Tomas going mad nearby. I was frightened for him. They would kill him, and I would <br>
  never see him again.<br>
  Lying on the cold floor I watched as Breandan's eyes flickered closed. I could feel the drug like <br>
  relaxation of whatever they had shot me with flowing through my body. Willing my own open was not <br>
  enough.<br>
  My lids slid closed and I slept.</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="911" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The world rocked. Breandan was carrying me. Uh, why was he carrying me? Memories rushed back in a <br>
  panicked jumble and my eyes flickered open. Devlin grinned down at me impishly. I screamed. I tore <br>
  at his face and back, but he kept moving, steady and sure. I kicked my legs so hard he jerked to a <br>
  stop and set me down. I turned to sprint away, but he grabbed my arm and rooted his feet.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="912" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Let go,” I demanded and wriggled in his grasp. “What have you done with him?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="913" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“With who? Your brother, your life-mate or your vampire?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="914" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I was stumped. I honestly didn't know which one to say. “All three,” I said and continued to try <br>
  and break his hold on me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="915" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Breandan and the vampire are alive. They're being taken to Orchard as we speak. Your brother <br>
  escaped a moment after you became unconscious, the vampire made a pest of himself and he slipped <br>
  away in the commotion.” Hearing this I stopped struggling, relieved everyone was alive. Devlin <br>
  relaxed his hold on me some. “It would be cruel to kill them before they got to see our ceremony.<br>
  The offering is the most beautiful human I have ever seen.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="916" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Don't you dare,” I shouted and pummeled him on the chest. Tears of frustration sprang in my eyes. <br>
  “Don't you hurt her, she's innocent.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="917" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Of course she is, and that is why she will make a good sacrifice.” He brushed strands of hair, <br>
  wet with tears, from my face and smiled. “I see you wish to save her and I have an idea. Give me <br>
  your amulet and I'll-”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="918" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His head snapped round.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="919" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My voice was loud and tremulous. “I'll never give you-”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="920" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin clamped a hand over my mouth and commanded with his eyes that I shut up. He cocked his head, <br>
  listening. His eyes narrowed and he dropped into a low crouch, taking me with him. The gods be <br>
  dammed, what now?</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="921" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Letting me go he pointed ahead and to the left then held up six fingers. Then pointed at me and <br>
  held up one finger. I stared at him blankly and he scowled,</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="922" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="923" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">repeated the motions. I nodded, slowly. He was telling me up ahead there was one fairy, a female <br>
  since he pointed at me and not himself. And six others. Uh, other what? I was not used to his sign <br>
  language and it was taking me a while. He meant six humans. This close to the Wall the only humans <br>
  that would wander outside were Oh gods. My mouth went dry, but I nodded again, firmer this time and <br>
  followed as he slinked forward.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="924" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">There was no time to argue, or get fussy about our allegiances. We were both in trouble if the <br>
  Clerics saw us. I broke into a cold sweat, remembering what I had seen the last time I had crawled <br>
  through the undergrowth in these woods.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="925" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin stopped, caught my shoulder and pointed again.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="926" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">As he did Clerics pushed through a thicket of branches and stomped into view. They moved in a tight <br>
  and square formation. All six had their hoods pulled up and covering their faces to the nose. Hand <br>
  clasped about their waists, their funneled sleeves concealed their hands, and the white-eye sigils <br>
  on their breast pockets seemed to shimmer against the crimson colour of the blazers.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="927" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The air left my lungs as I caught sight of the demon stumbling behind the marching column, a fairy <br>
  with a black sack over her head, and iron chains about her neck, hands and ankles. Slashes of blood <br>
  stood out on her green skin, and her body - glistening with sweat - was a navy colour along the <br>
  knees and torso, probably deep muscle bruises.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="928" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin hissed, a low and primal sound. He glanced at me and I saw murder in his eye. I knew then <br>
  these Clerics were dead, and no words I said would convince him to show mercy. Devlin was a fairy <br>
  purist. He would never let any of our<br>
  kind be treated this way.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="929" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I pointed at myself then at the fairy, a simple communication. He scanned the trees and nodded; <br>
  satisfied I could get the job done without getting in his way. He slinked off to the side and <br>
  disappeared from my sight behind a tree. I waited alone, tense, and terrified of the quickening of <br>
  my heart from a rising<br>
  excitement. The column was directly opposite me now. I sunk lower, scared even in the dark and they <br>
  would see me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="930" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">There was a sharp crack, and the sound of a snapping branch to the west. They all spun, guns and <br>
  knives appearing in their hands as they did. The column halted and was still. Another noise, this <br>
  time a tree shaking to the north and the</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="931" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="932" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">column spun again, another snap back to the west then another to the south. Devlin was distracting <br>
  them, but never did he draw their gaze my way. There was a flash of white and a scream that choked <br>
  off mid flow. The column was now five. The Clerics swelled out into a defensive formation, not <br>
  knowing nothing could save them now.<br>
  Sensing my queue, I crawled around to the back where the fairy was standing. Her knees were bent <br>
  and she was alert, knowing her time to escape had come.<br>
  The clerics were shouting now, fighting. Though the fairy-lord would be able to handle himself, I <br>
  spared a look for Devlin to check he was doing okay. The vision of necks snapping, a knife in the <br>
  eye and sight of a Cleric going limp as the bones of his body shattered when it connected with a <br>
  tree trunk, was not something I wanted to see or get a look at in more detail.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="933" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I reached the fairy-girl, and put my hands on the shackles at her ankles. The immediate burn was <br>
  unexpected and I yelped. Iron. At my yell, she shrieked and kicked, hitting me in the side and <br>
  toppling herself over. She thrashed around and I scrambled over to clamp my hands on her arms.<br>
  “Stop fighting me, I'm not going to hurt you.” She became still under my hands.<br>
  “Rae?” Her voice was a whimper and I remembered the light chime of it instantly. I dragged the hood <br>
  off her head and released a fiery cascade of hair. Her scarlet eyes were wide and wet. “It's you,” <br>
  she sobbed and started to cry. “I'm saved, you saved me.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="934" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I hushed her; anxious the Clerics would hear us. “Calm, Maeve, it's okay now. I'm going to get <br>
  these binds off you.”<br>
  I looked over her chains. A familiar nausea rose in my throat at the odor and look of the iron. Her <br>
  skin was backend, blistering where it touched her.<br>
  “They were moving me somewhere else because there were demons in the compound. One of us has killed <br>
  one of them, and the humans are furious. They were going to take me away so you couldn't save me. I <br>
  think there's another secret place they hide the demons they catch.” She was babbling, and her eyes <br>
  darted around wildly. “They asked me questions. Who I was, how many fairies I</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="935" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="936" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">lived with and where I lived. I couldn't get away from them. They kept me dosed with iron, all the <br>
  time. I'm weak.”<br>
  To placate her I nodded sympathetically and made commiserating noises. I fumbled over the chains, <br>
  but couldn't break them. I tried covering my hands with mud then using leaves as make shift covers, <br>
  but they tore the moment I exerted any strength and the mud did nothing. There was a tap at my <br>
  shoulder. Devlin held out a blood soaked hand to me. I recoiled then realized there was a small key <br>
  between his slick fingertips. I snatched it from him in my haste to get Maeve free. As the chains <br>
  fell away, she clambered on top of me and hugged me tightly.<br>
  Devlin started to bury the chains. Shame he didn't have the same inclination about the human bodies <br>
  he'd dismembered. I glared at him with disgust.<br>
  “You found me,” Maeve cried and buried her small head in the crook of my shoulder.<br>
  I patted her awkwardly. She didn't smell too great. Something golden and hard knocked my hand as I <br>
  stroked her hair, and I lifted a few braids curiously. On the end of one dangled a small coin sized <br>
  disc. It had a single rune etched onto its surface.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="937" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“It means protection,” she said her eyes misted with guilt. “I took it because I was afraid to ask <br>
  Breandan for it. I've known where that silly burl he hides his secrets in was, since I was old <br>
  enough to crawl. I was so mad at him for treating me like a child, but I was more afraid of facing <br>
  a vampire alone, so I stole it.” Her gaze bored into mine, pleading for understanding. “Take it. It <br>
  didn't work for me because it was always meant for you.”<br>
  Then her eyes crashed closed, and she promptly fell into a deep sleep.<br>
  I sat there, her limbs entwined with mine, unsure of what to do. I didn't push her away. She needed <br>
  me, and since Breandan was not there, I needed to provide her with some comfort. Holding her <br>
  soothed away the guilt of seeing her hurt by the people I had once looked up to.<br>
  Devlin brushed clumps of soil from his hands and watched us, eyes clouded, distant. His white hair <br>
  shimmered brightly, and his green eyes made the vibrant colors of the forest seem washed out. It <br>
  was scary someone so beautiful could wreak such carnage. He didn't seem at all put out.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="938" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="939" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“You saved her,” I said, struggling to understand him. “You saved your enemies sister.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="940" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin came back to himself and smirked at me pityingly. “I saved a member of my Tribe. Don't you <br>
  see, Rae? The rebels are still part of my Tribe and they will be until the day I no longer rule, <br>
  which I promise you will be many years to come. They may not agree with me or encourage Lochlann's <br>
  tantrum and defy me for a while, but so be it.” He shrugged like it really didn't bother him, but I <br>
  knew otherwise. “In the end I will win because leading the Tribe is my birthright. As is mating <br>
  with a female fairy of my choice.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="941" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I clutched Maeve tighter to my chest, a wary look coming into me eye. Devlin laughed, waved his <br>
  hand.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="942" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“A female fairy of mating age. Maeve is pretty but too young. And I want my mate to be from one of <br>
  the older bloodlines.” His eyes rested on my wings and tail then skipped over my face.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="943" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“That's why you're so set on having me? Because you think it's your right to?” I shook my head. “I <br>
  don't understand you, Devlin. I don't feel for you that way and I know for a fact you don't like <br>
  me.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="944" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I am a practical being and so are you.” He laughed heartily. “Our ancestor's legacy flows strongly <br>
  through your veins, and you could help bring us back together. Mating with you would be the right <br>
  thing to do, but I won't.” He smiled softly. “There is one who holds my heart firmly in her vicious <br>
  clasp.” He looked down at his hands and seemed surprised to see the blood there. The softness bled <br>
  from his expression. “Breandan overstepped his place. Even if you and I did not mate it would be <br>
  Lochlann who would court you next. He has turned his back on tradition thousands of years old.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="945" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“He saw me first,” I said, finally understanding what that statement meant. If Breandan had managed <br>
  to ignore me we never would have met the way we did, and maybe we never would have bonded. I saw <br>
  now our connection was largely attributed to the improbable success of our meeting and was <br>
  intrinsically linked to the awakening of the demon within me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="946" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Concerned I would wake her, I gently lay Maeve down on the mossy floor. I unhooked the amulet from <br>
  her braid and tucked it into my pocket. I felt a small thrill at knowing I know had all three. I <br>
  had the key that would bring Devlin and</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="947" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="948" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">his evil hoard down. All I had to do was escape him, and get the grimoire. How I was to do that was <br>
  beyond me. Conall would be close by, but he would be focusing on freeing Lochlann. The little I <br>
  knew of my brother told me he was a stickler for tradition and the right way of doing things. More <br>
  importantly, Devlin had my boys and I wanted them back. I was not done with them yet, we had <br>
  unfinished business.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="949" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I stood and looked Devlin in the eye, crossed my hands over my chest.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="950" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Help me, Rae. Breandan will understand. He'll be upset but eventually he will accept. If you join <br>
  with me, take your rightful place in my Tribe we can put an end to this feud.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="951" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I stared at him and almost stuttered when I said, “No.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="952" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His hands clamped down on my shoulders and he shook me roughly. “Don't be foolish, you have a <br>
  chance to save many of our kind.” He quirked an eyebrow and was amused. “I'll even let you keep the <br>
  amulet of power you stole from me. You didn't think your casting broke through my shield all by <br>
  itself did you?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="953" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My lips pressed into a thin line. “I admit I should have known it was not my natural ability that <br>
  kicked your ass, but what do you mean you'll let me keep it? I took and you can't give something <br>
  that's not yours anymore.” I looked at his hand on my shoulder, fought the urge to set it on fire <br>
  to get him off me. “How did you get the amulet of power anyway? It makes sense Conall and I are <br>
  guardians, the last Priestess was our mother.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="954" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Sorcha, your mother gave it to me. Oh, don't look so shocked. Her husband was my uncle, and after <br>
  his death I was the next male in line to rule.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="955" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I digested this, painfully slow. “My father was royal?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="956" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin tipped his head back and laughed so uproariously I began to feel hot.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="957" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Your farther was High Lord until his wife sheathed a dagger in his heart. After she broke it of <br>
  course, lying with a human.” He snorted. “I always liked Sorcha and she me, but she was a foolish <br>
  woman.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="958" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Was?” I whispered. No one had confirmed my mother was dead, but then I knew in the core of me, <br>
  she had not survived the horror of her own making.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="959" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="960" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He stared at me, pitiful once more. “She killed my uncle and the High lord, Rae. You expected her <br>
  to live?”</p>

  <h2 id="chp10" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Chapter Ten</h2>
  <p class = "para1" id="962" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  It was cold. Noisy. Feeling returned in increments. First I could wiggle my fingers, toes then my <br>
  legs. I moaned at the thumping at my temple and tried to bring my hands down to my face. My eyes <br>
  groggily slid half-open when I realized I could not move them to obey. I looked down my body, now <br>
  clad in a flimsy black sheath, and saw my legs drawn apart and held down by rough rope. I tried to <br>
  remember, but the fog was still heavy over me and it was dark. I could smell trees, dirt, and fresh <br>
  air heavy with smoke and something else, metallic and weird. I recognized this smell was wrong, <br>
  bad, and yet so familiar. I tried to pull my legs, my arms, but I could do nothing but flail. <br>
  Gasping, I drew deep and gritted my teeth. I opened my eyes fully and took in my surroundings.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="963" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">All around me were leaves, thick purple leaves with sharp silver thorns.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="964" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Slowly, my mind struggled to piece it together. I shivered, and shook my head as it hit me in <br>
  flashes. Breandan had been dragged to the centre of the camp and cruelly beaten. Lochlann had been <br>
  held back, and Maeve had been thrust into his arms, sobbing.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="965" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Tomas had been brought forward, snarling and fighting as they bound him.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="966" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Wasp had enjoyed slapping the chains around my neck a little too much. I'd been hoisted up to hang <br>
  from a thick tree bough, and was bound so tightly I'd lost feeling in my limbs. The smell of iron <br>
  made me retch and heave. Then the pretty fairy had smiled wickedly before she punched me, and I'd <br>
  lost consciousness.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="967" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I was awake now, and wishing she'd hit me harder.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="968" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Directly opposite me, my vampire-boy was suffering. Bound with silver, skin red raw where it rubbed <br>
  against his wrists, he looked furious.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="969" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Next time you listen to me,” he said.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="970" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I gave him a wobbly smile. “You think there'll be a next time?” A chain slid against my wrist and I <br>
  winced.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="971" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">If such a thing was possible, his eyes darkened as he looked over my shoulder. I</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="972" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="973" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">craned my neck around to see Breandan on his knees, bound in wreathes of iron chains. Maeve had <br>
  woken and was in front of him, trying to hug him and crying and apologizing. Lochlann stood <br>
  protectively near them, statue still and head held high. I guessed he could do nothing since he had <br>
  been defeated. He had no choice but to let Devlin continue with this madness, unless he was <br>
  rescued.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="974" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I decided then that fairy rules were stupid and melodramatic.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="975" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I whispered a wish that Conall would be nearby, and that he would save us before anything bad <br>
  happened.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="976" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin shouted something, and his voice drew my eyes to where he stood. Beautiful fairies were <br>
  gathered around me chanting. The orange glow of a roaring, smoky fire flickered across exposed <br>
  skins. Creatures with ears pointed and teeth fanged, swayed to a throbbing pulse I could feel <br>
  vibrating my skeleton. They were like me, my kind. The side of my head throbbed, and I clung to <br>
  consciousness. Oh gods this was bad. Feet clawed and scaled pounded the ground in a tribal rhythm. <br>
  The beating of chest, feathered and armored blended into a melodic clamor. Fingers sunk into the <br>
  earth to scoop bracken from the floor, and heave it into the air with flourish, letting it sprinkle <br>
  over them like polluted rain. Clothes thin, transparent as the smoke that snaked around them, <br>
  billowed and streamed in the wind as they gyrated and preened around my bound body. Every beady <br>
  eye, fluttery lash and arced eyebrow was directed at me, yet the mouths and bodies whined a tune I <br>
  was too dizzy to recognize. They shrieked and hissed. Leaping and dancing they groped and kissed, <br>
  smiled and bit. Blood was drawn with screeches of rancor and their lusty whimpers whipped up a <br>
  hungered frenzy.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="977" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I blinked, and focused hard on the centre of the commotion. They danced around something wide, flat <br>
  and gray, raised from the floor. An alter. The human lying on the stone slab moaned and writhed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="978" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Alex,” I whispered.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="979" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">She moaned again, and twitched. She was coming too. I wished she would stay under so that she could <br>
  be spared the horror.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="980" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I call you fairies here to partake in this delight. The night is our master.” Devlin's voice, <br>
  raspy and thick cried out. His words were carried away on the wind into the darkness. He stood at <br>
  the foot of the dais, handsome and magnetic.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="981" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="982" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">His hair flowed like golden corn. Eyes wide and clear as the sky in summer. Face luminous, pale and <br>
  stunningly angelic. He held a simple curved blade in hands, too perfect to be human. Beneath his <br>
  ebony robe he was naked, and the moonlight reflected off his pearlescent skin. A terrifyingly evil <br>
  aura pulsed from within him.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="983" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Our master,” murmured the beautiful voices.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="984" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“She is pure. We offer her to the night with glee in our hearts, and blood in our mouths.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="985" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin took a deep drink from a silver chalice then spilled the rest of the contents over Alex's <br>
  body. The metallic scent from before reached my nose. A few splashes dripped into Alex's mouth and <br>
  terror gripped her so hard she screamed, arcing her back. The skin under her bindings tore.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="986" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“We offer this human child. We give thanks to the night that blesses us with sex, blood and death.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="987" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“This is not happening,” I said loudly.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="988" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Rae?” Alex choked and squinted, trying to make me out in the low light. Her eyes went wide and she <br>
  started to thrash around. “Help me, oh gods, what's happening?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="989" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin slapped her across the face. Alex kept shouting for me and pulled harder on the rope that <br>
  bound her. I had nothing to help her. I didn't even have any words to soothe her. I tried to reach <br>
  to the Source; I could feel it all around me, calling to me. All I had to do was touch it. I <br>
  panted, and grunted, and tried to extend my influence past my own body, but the iron was <br>
  overwhelming.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="990" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A cloaked figure stood in the melee, utterly silent and composed. A deep cowl was drawn over his <br>
  head, and I could see nothing but the gleam of calm and cold eyes peering at me. I got the greatest <br>
  sense of danger from him, so I looked away and struggled harder. My wrists burned and chafed, but I <br>
  kept writhing.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="991" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“My brothers, sisters. The Tribe protects you and pleases you with fresh meat.” Panting, I <br>
  continued to struggle. I just needed one arm free, just one leg. “A body to drink revel and break.” <br>
  Devlin's voice clotted with lust.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="992" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="993" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A new fear shot through me hot and hard. He wouldn't dare.<br>
  His mouth trawled over Alex, and she convulsed in disgust as his clawed fingers dragged leisurely <br>
  across her skin. Wasp was beside him and laughed throatily.<br>
  My eyes stung, and the salt in my tears tasted bitter as it slipped into my mouth.<br>
  “The night is our master, our lover our warrior. The night is our master.” Over and over and over <br>
  they chanted, rising and falling in tempo.<br>
  Hair red as blood, a female threw back her head and shrieked at the moon. A bare-chested male with <br>
  yellow jewels for eyes rocked on his heels and bared his teeth. Snarly razors filled my vision. He <br>
  was smiling at me, and those eyes, those glowing eyes snuck into my mind and stoked the fires of my <br>
  hysteria. I stared back in mute horror as he jumped onto the altar by Alex's head, and let out an <br>
  undulating cry.<br>
  I looked up into the sky, through the dark shadow of trees and succumbed to fear. I stopped <br>
  struggling.<br>
  “She can't die like this.”<br>
  Wasp's hand slid down Alex's chest and cupped her breast, squeezed.<br>
  “Please,” I begged, clamping my eyes shut as Alex's screams increased as her dress was pushed up <br>
  her torso, and the wailing from the fairies got louder.<br>
  “Look at me Rae.” Tomas’ voice was urgent. I tore my eyes away from Alex to him. “Don't watch,” he <br>
  whispered.<br>
  “Do something,” I sobbed.<br>
  He looked stricken and tried to free himself. Like me was held by chains that drained his strength <br>
  and mental abilities, and there was nothing he could do. The clear dark that followed him around <br>
  was a frazzled gray.<br>
  “Rae,” Alex said quietly, so calm and collected it reached me through the chaos. “Don't look away, <br>
  I want to see your face.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="994" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="995" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My tears streamed as I turned to her. “You're going to die.”<br>
  “I love you.” She smiled and the blue runes on her check crinkled. “You my best friend. I don't <br>
  know what you are or who you are, but that don't change the way I feel, y'know?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="996" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I nodded frantically and braced myself. “I love you too.” It was the first time and last I would <br>
  ever say those words. They were hers and hers alone.<br>
  Another hand, smaller with razors for nails trailed down her stomach, across her hip. Alex cried <br>
  out in pain as the cries of anticipation shattered the night. The noise and clamor reached peak as <br>
  Wasp fisted her hand in Alex's hair, drawing her head back, almost in tenderness. Devlin lifted the <br>
  blade high above his head, and the wicked sharp edge flickered with light. Then he</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="997" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Another scream erupted from me so loud a blood vessel burst in my eye. My scream cut off, no more <br>
  air in my lungs to carry the sound.<br>
  The figure cloaked in black threw back his hood. Conall.<br>
  My heart crashed in my chest as screams, sounds of death and violence surround me. I was too <br>
  terrified to open my eyes. All I could see was Devlin's dagger sinking into Alex's throat and the <br>
  gush of blood. The bonds at my hands went slack. My feet were free and I kicked for all I was <br>
  worth. Screaming. Too far gone to fight properly, I lashed out like a wild animal. Firm, but gentle <br>
  hands lifted me up and held me close. I kept my eyes pressed shut in defense against whatever <br>
  torture I was to be subjected to.<br>
  “Be still Rae, I will not harm you,” a calm voice commanded.<br>
  The voice was singsong, not raspy and seductive. It hinted of magic and light. Still, I pushed, and <br>
  shoved, and bit with my teeth. I yelled and screamed.<br>
  “She can take no more, Lochlann,” Maeve's high chine sounded sad. “Leave her.”<br>
  “No,” I said hoarsely. “I won't be fooled. You're all evil. Demon monsters!” I thrashed about, <br>
  hoping to drag an eye out and to my grave with me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="998" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="999" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Watch. Your brother avenges your friend as you bawl like a baby.” My yelling stopped and my eyes <br>
  popped open.<br>
  Conall had become a phantom figure, massacring the bewildered fairies prancing in the inner circle. <br>
  A blur, he ripped and tore the beasts to pieces like crepe<br>
  paper. There was nothing but a whisper of sound as death claimed those who'd held us captive. He <br>
  disposed of any lingering survivors with a snap of the spine, or blade through flesh. Headless <br>
  bodies tottered and fell as hot guts spilled onto the cold ground. Then it was done and he was <br>
  still.<br>
  Clad in snugly fitted pants, and soft boots he was tall and sinewy. His dark hair was ponytailed, <br>
  resting loosely across board shoulders. His skin glowed like a beacon and his ears had the <br>
  distinctive point of fairy. With competent ease, he wielded his sword in one hand, and saluted to <br>
  Lochlann with the other. Leather hilted the shiny steel of his sword was drenched in what looked <br>
  like red paint. Chest splattered in blood and gore, clutched in his other hand was the dismembered <br>
  head of a fairy. Savagely lifting it high, he laughed boomingly and blood dribbled from the ragged <br>
  hole where the neck used to join to the body. He tossed it indifferently and it landed with a <br>
  squelch to roll and gather the pine leaves on the forest floor.<br>
  Orchard, the fairy wyld was littered with mutilated fairy bodies and I felt nothing but bone deep <br>
  satisfaction.<br>
  I scrambled over to the dais, and sank to my knees over Alex's body. Her eyes were wide and <br>
  starring, mouth slightly parted. Rocking back and forth, I wound my fingers into my hair and <br>
  wailed. She was dead. Gone. I could never laugh or joke with my friend again. She had lost her life <br>
  for my mistakes, my foolishness. I couldn't bear it, and nor would I have to.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1000" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I placed both my hands on her eyes and called magic to me. It came reluctantly, already forming <br>
  into something dark and unnatural. As I stood in the way of natural order, my nature rumbled with <br>
  discontent. I was meant to bring balance, not perversion. I didn't care, so I ignored my instincts.<br>
  I did not have time to think of the ramifications of what I was doing. I couldn't let her go, and I <br>
  hoped in time she would forgive me, and understand why I did what I did. I muttered the name of one <br>
  who might take pity on her.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1001" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1002" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Her body twitched beneath my hands as if I had zapped her, and I said it again, louder this time.<br>
  “What is she doing?” someone asked sharply behind me. “Loa!”<br>
  Her eyelids fluttered.<br>
  If this could work, if I could call on the voodoo deity and call back someone from the grave, it <br>
  would be Alex. She was the daughter of powerful mambo, a voodoo Sorceress who ran wild in demon <br>
  territory, and battled against witchcraft before the Clerics hunted her down. But Alex had been <br>
  spared. The Clerics had taken her to the Priests for judgment as a child and they had declared her <br>
  human, believing the spark had missed her. I could sense something within her. A glimmer of the <br>
  magic her mother could touch and manipulate. I had never taken her roots seriously the few times <br>
  she had spoken of it, and all that time I'd known her, in her own way she had been asking me to <br>
  believe in her.<br>
  There. I had it under control. Her life force was trying to depart, but I tethered it to her body.<br>
  “Forgive me,” I whispered in her ear. All I had to do was lock her soul within her body and she <br>
  would wake.<br>
  A heavy pressure at the base of my neck shocked me still. Mercifully, it went black.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1003" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Before I opened my eyes, I smelt him. His mineral and damp earth smell. I opened my eyes and <br>
  concluded it had all gone to hell. Tomas was burning. Whorls of smoke rose from his skin, and his <br>
  head drooped forward. The silver hung him from a tree and bit into his skin cruelly.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1004" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It felt like a sack of bricks weighted down each of my eyelids, and my bones slid around inside me.<br>
  “Let him down,” I croaked.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1005" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1006" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Lochlann's glacial gaze fell on me, and his face was hard. “He has taken a life,” he said stonily. <br>
  “By fairy law he dies.”<br>
  I shook my head. It felt spongy and full of empty space. “What life? Uh, the Cleric was going to <br>
  kill me. He saved me.”<br>
  “He has killed a fairy. He faces the sun.”<br>
  “You're wrong,” I said, fuming he was bold enough to try and take Tomas’ life with such an <br>
  outrageous claim.<br>
  He couldn't have killed anyone; he hadn't had the time to.<br>
  “We found her body, Rae,” Conall said and knelt down in front of me. Maeve was a step behind him, <br>
  her eyes wide and sorrowful. “Her throat was mauled and her blood drained.”<br>
  “There are shifters around. The fairy wylds border a Pride, don't they? And the blood, if she was <br>
  mauled she would have bled out.”<br>
  “His trail led from her body to the place in the Wall Breandan took you. We guess it is here you <br>
  met him?”<br>
  Denial at Conall's explanation died on my lips when Tomas’ own words came to me as a distant echo. <br>
  “I have already eaten, a skinny girl, bitter.” Was I really to believe a starving vampire would <br>
  come across a lone fairy and not bite her?<br>
  It didn't matter. The thought stoked the fires of my anger, and I rolled onto my hands and knees. <br>
  It didn't matter because he was mine. I gained my feet and ignored the fact the floor rippled.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1007" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">As I spoke, I staggered forward. “I am sorry for your loss, but you need to let him go.”<br>
  “Bind her,” Lochlann ordered.<br>
  Chains appeared in Maeve's hands, which I now saw were wrapped in cloth, and she looped one around <br>
  my neck and snaked the other around my torso. I dropped like a stone. Was I really so predictable <br>
  they had prepared the one person who I would never see as a threat with chains? I stared up at her, <br>
  horrified.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1008" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1009" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">She looked away in shame and turned her back on me. “I'm sworn to him, Rae. I have no choice.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1010" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I looked to the east and saw the tip of the sun kiss the sky. We were still shaded by the trees. <br>
  There was time.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1011" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall was still on his knees, trying to comfort me, but he preempted my plea, “I too am oath sworn <br>
  to Lochlann, and I do not think this creature should live.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1012" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I looked him in the eye. “You say you're my brother.” “Always.”<br>
  “Then help me,” I said. “Just take him down so he can hide.” He looked away. “I cannot.”<br>
  My eyes spun round, but even as I thought his name, I realized the folly of my hope. The fairy-boy <br>
  I was bonded to, and supposed to mate for life with would save the vampire-boy who I had a blood <br>
  tie to and who shared half of my heart? Still, I looked to him. Hoping he would find some <br>
  compassion for a fellow demon and save him. Breandan was no longer bound to Lochlann's will and <br>
  could act as he chose. He avoided my gaze and turned his back to me. No word or other gesture could <br>
  be so bold a statement.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1013" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The first rays of the morning warmed my arm and splayed across my face. I locked gazes with Tomas, <br>
  who breathed hard, eyes wide.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1014" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“I am not afraid,” he told me. “But I regret-” He groaned and gasped in pain.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1015" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I battled with the chains, tears of frustration and pain sliding down my cheeks at the realization <br>
  I could not break them on my own.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1016" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Be still, Rae,” Conall urged. “Can you not see the evil you have tied yourself to? This is for the <br>
  best, little sister.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1017" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I couldn't do it. I could not watch another person die for me. If I had listened to him we never <br>
  would have been captured, and I never would have watched Devlin steal the life away from the most <br>
  beautiful and vibrant person I'd known. I closed my eyes against the coming horror. Gods, give me <br>
  strength. A prickle of</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="1019" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">power radiated outwards from my chest. The amulets! I had forgotten all about them. Maeve had made <br>
  a mistake. The iron around my neck and torso drained my strength, but this time I could move my <br>
  arms and legs.<br>
  Sunlight touched Tomas face and he started to burn. His fangs ran out and his eyes glazed over <br>
  black. His skin looked awful in the light, translucent. As the daybreak grew it blackened and <br>
  peeled away.<br>
  It was a struggle, but I stood, keeping my eyes on Tomas. He needed me, now was not the time to be <br>
  weak. I slipped my hand into my pocket pulled the amulet of protection out.<br>
  Lochlann lunged for me and I sent him flying with a pulse of energy. He landed on his feet, but <br>
  seemed winded. He hesitated before trying again. Good, because I didn't think I had much control <br>
  left in me. The next people to get in my way were in for a rough ride.<br>
  “Stop her,” he commanded.<br>
  Maeve came next and I dodged her easily enough, she wasn't even trying. Conall tried to grab me, <br>
  but the look I sent him had him over-shooting his aim by a mile. Lochlann went for me again, but <br>
  Breandan wheeled round to plant himself between his brother and me.<br>
  “Move,” Lochlann said. “You risked everything by defying me, and I allowed it because you are my <br>
  brother. I will not let you unleash another danger upon our kind.”<br>
  “This has nothing to do with you anymore. You may not touch her.” “Young fool. She chooses another <br>
  and you stand by and let her.”<br>
  Breandan shrugged and the defeated slump of his shoulders was heart wrenching to see. I didn't have <br>
  time to reassure him, or thank him.<br>
  I pulled the amulets of wisdom and power that hung from the leather cord around my neck, and <br>
  slipped the amulet of protection into the last place. The air stilled and then crackled with a zing <br>
  of electricity you could reach out and touch. My hair was swept up in a cyclone of wind, and I <br>
  breathed in the scent of soil and sunlight that reminded me of Breandan. He was close and he was on <br>
  my</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="1021" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">side. His strength and dedication to me helped me see who I really was. I was Rae. The last pure <br>
  fairy who could wield the power of the key and who was destined to be a Priestess. It was my <br>
  purpose to lead these demons from the darkness.<br>
  I was not afraid. I was strong and I had magic.<br>
  Drawing deeply on the Source, filling every nook of myself with power and energy I called to the <br>
  forest then flung myself at Tomas. I crashed into him and the tree bough cracked, almost like it <br>
  gave way for me. It seemed like we fell forever, entwined, gazes locked. The tree groaned and swept <br>
  down, its branches twisting and curling into a shroud around us. We landed hard, me straddling him, <br>
  and the ground rumbled and shook in a tumult. In an explosion of mud tree roots shot up from <br>
  beneath the earth to surround us. I glimpsed the bright and<br>
  beautiful dawn as the tree roots and boughs smashed together, encasing us in a living tomb. Then it <br>
  was dark.<br>
  Tomas trembled beneath my body. He felt hot as I ran my hands over his face, and I winced. It was <br>
  cracked and rough. He smelt foul like, well, burnt flesh and I gagged. Easing off him, I steadied <br>
  myself and placed my wrist over his mouth.<br>
  “Tomas,” I said, breathless. “You have to feed before you die for the day.”<br>
  He didn't move. I rubbed my wrist over his mouth and then instinct took over. His teeth sunk into <br>
  me and I lay there as he drank himself better. It was not long before he moaned and then his head <br>
  hit the floor with a solid thunk. I ran my hands over his face. He felt cooler and his face <br>
  smoother.<br>
  “Was that enough? Will you wake up again?” He was quiet for a moment. “I believe I will.”<br>
  I touched his cheek and the skin slowly healing blackened under my touch. I jerked away. “I'm <br>
  hurting you. My skin, it's glowing, I-I think it's sunlight.”<br>
  At any other time or with any other vampire, sunlight seeping through my pores would be crazily <br>
  fortuitous, but my voice was horrified. Eyes closed, his fingers searched for mine. Again his skin <br>
  burned the moment he touched me, and I tried to pull away, not understanding why I was causing him <br>
  more pain. There was no off switch, and though my light was dimming, I didn't want to risk hurting <br>
  him.</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="1024" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">My skin looked dark next to his. He looked deader than usual and it scared me. The glow of my skin <br>
  had cranked it down a notch and he held on tighter.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1025" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Does it hurt?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1026" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Yes,” he said slowly, and sounded like if he had the energy to make fun of me, he would. “Rae, <br>
  promise me something?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1027" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“That depends. The last time I agreed to something before knowing what it was, it caused me a lot <br>
  of trouble.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1028" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He coughed and laughed. It was a wet, horrible sound and I grimaced. “Go ahead then, tell me.”<br>
  His eyes sparkled like shiny rocks before the lights in them went out, and they slid closed. He <br>
  died for the day.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1029" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Tell me,” I said loudly, panicked.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1030" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">It was in vain. He was beyond me now and would not be within my reach until the sunset. I watched <br>
  as my blood healed his body, faster than if it had been human blood. For once I felt relief that I <br>
  was fairy, being this way had helped him survive.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1031" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I was tired and sad, but the silence and stillness was not welcome. I was worried about what would <br>
  happen when I stepped from the living shroud. I ran my palm over the earthen roof above me, and <br>
  blinked when dirt fell in my eyes. The walls and floor were soft and hard. A mixture of leaves, mud <br>
  and bark. There was a root dug into my back and I shifted closer to my slumbering vampire-boy. He <br>
  was cold again and though it made me shiver, I scooted closer and rested my head on his chest.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1032" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The best thing, I figured, would be to wait for sunset. Tomas would hopefully be better and he <br>
  could have more of my blood if he needed.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1033" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan was going to be mad.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1034" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1035" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">The thought alone was enough for me to want to be entombed there for the rest of my days. In the <br>
  end, he had helped me save Tomas, but I knew he was not happy. I could feel he was not happy. He <br>
  was also close by, so close if I was to stand he would probably be sitting less than a few paces <br>
  away. Guarding me. I was proud that he had chosen to do the right thing, even though he knew it <br>
  might mean losing my love to another. It made me love him more. Gods, how selfish was I? I loved <br>
  Breandan but was too afraid to tell him. He was already crazy possessive and I was not okay with <br>
  that. I was bonded to him by magic and that was commitment enough as far as I was concerned.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1036" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">A further problem was that Tomas was a part of my being now. As much as I needed air to breath, I <br>
  knew I would need him around. Just being next to him was dangerous. He was a starving vampire who <br>
  was disconnected from his humanity, and unscrupulous in his belief he had to kill to survive. Yet I <br>
  found him endearing and worth saving.<br>
  Conall would be pissed too, not that he had a right. I was going to have words with that brother of <br>
  mine and none of them were going to be nice. He had failed me. I could understand why he could not <br>
  save Alex; his main concern was recuing Lochlann and Breandan so they could fight.<br>
  Tears I thought I had already cried out ran down my face as I thought of my friend. She had been so <br>
  brave, in the end. She had not looked at me with hate and disgust, but told me she loved me. Gods, <br>
  as much as I hated it, I could accept it because she did. I had tried to save her, to reanimate her <br>
  body using the voodoo practices of her bloodline, but it hadn't worked. I'd been stopped. There was <br>
  nothing else to do but take her body back to Temple and back to Ro. He would hate me too, for he <br>
  was smart and would figure it out. The easy thing would be to bury her out here so no one knew of <br>
  her death, but I couldn't do that. Her life deserved to be celebrated. All I could do was try to <br>
  explain and hope Ro could forgive me, as she did.<br>
  I felt a stirring of anger. Lochlann, he was a problem. I thought he was going to be the good guy. <br>
  He would continue to try and justify his actions by saying Tomas had killed a fairy. I would not <br>
  let him take his life. Tomas had to make amends for the life he had taken - I was not sure how I <br>
  would get him to do it, but I would - and I did not give a damn what power Lochlann thought he had <br>
  to condemn my vampire-boy to death.</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="1038" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Breandan's reluctance to go to the Grove made sense now, as did the fairies reaction to news that <br>
  we were bonded. The fairy Priestess were usually the life- mates of the fairy-lords. Lochlann was <br>
  trying to overthrow Devlin, who definitely needed overthrowing, and that would make him High Lord <br>
  of all fairykind. The Priestess kept the spiritual balance and the High Lord kept physical order. <br>
  Breandan had not wanted to see me, because he knew we would be stealing his brother's future mate. <br>
  Yet, he could not help but seek me out, knowing that the white witch had seen we were to be <br>
  together.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1039" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Anger became rage as Devlin, skewering Alex, flashed across my memory again. He would die, and I <br>
  sent a fervent wish it would be by my hand. I was<br>
  going to become so powerful just hearing my name would stop his heart. I would find him and destroy <br>
  him, laughing as I did so.<br>
  Guilt I would never be able to shake, crept over me and memories of Alex bombarded my vision. I <br>
  sobbed. Again, I tormented myself with the depth of my failure. It hadn't worked. I had tried to <br>
  save her, and it had failed miserably.<br>
  I lay down beside my vampire-boy, the one I had been able to save, and cried for the one I had <br>
  lost. Lying in the dark with death itself had me wallowing and sinking deeper into a place I did <br>
  not need to be. I needed the sunlight. I needed Breandan.<br>
  Tomas was going nowhere, and this shroud was nice and tight. I called on the Source and asked the <br>
  forest to bury him deeper. The ground rumbled and more roots emerged from the cool earthen floor to <br>
  wrap around his lifeless body and cocoon him. Happy he would be safe from the sun; I dug a small <br>
  opening for myself and crawled out. A hand gripped my forearm tightly and pulled. I emerged from <br>
  the shroud and blinked rapidly at the bright sunshine.<br>
  I looked around tentatively, on guard for any attack, but the camp was empty. The fire was now a <br>
  smoldering pile of ash, and the only evidence of the nightmare at dawn was the fresh trails in the <br>
  undergrowth. My gaze settled on the stone slab, still awash with blood. I trembled.<br>
  “Where is she?”<br>
  Breandan rubbed my arms, soothing me. “Maeve is tending to her body. We are going to burn her, a <br>
  queenly funeral.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1040" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1041" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“No. I want to take her back to Temple.”<br>
  The soothing caress stopped. “You know how the humans will react.” His voice was calm, as if he <br>
  knew that was what I had wanted all along.<br>
  “It's the right thing to do. I won't burn her like a dirty secret.” “Alright.”<br>
  We were quiet for a while. He seemed serene and I could sense no anger bubbling under the surface.<br>
  “You don't hate me?” I blurted, unable to contain myself. “Never. Though, I wish you were simpler.”<br>
  I snorted and rubbed some mud out of my hair. I flexed and extended my wings and sighed in relief.<br>
  “Where did everybody go?”<br>
  “Back to the Grove. Lochlann cannot stay here until he is High Lord. This wyld is for the ruling <br>
  family.”<br>
  “Where has Devlin is gone? Will we be able to track him and his followers?”<br>
  Yes. But he is still High Lord. There are rules, Rae. Devlin must be tried against the laws of our <br>
  people and the lordship removed from him by popular vote. Only then can a new High Lord be chosen.”<br>
  I sighed, hearing between the lines. “For Lochlann to rule, Devlin must live.”<br>
  “Oh yes. That is the way it must be. At least, until the power has been transferred.”<br>
  “I will kill him,” I said bluntly. “And I'm going to stop you.”<br>
  Again, we were at opposite ends of the spectrum. The truth was, I didn't care what he wanted, or <br>
  what Lochlann wanted. I wanted Alex to be avenged.</p>

  <p class = "para1" id="1043" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Nothing was going to get in my way.<br>
  “He murdered Alex, and for what? She was an innocent.”<br>
  “I know you are grieving.” Breandan stroked my face temple to jaw. “I will help you to heal.”<br>
  I went into his arms then and let him hold me. The hurt in me was an ocean I thought would never <br>
  run dry. All I could do was protect what I had, and avenge what I had lost. There I stood, in the <br>
  arms of my fairy-boy, standing over the resting place of my vampire-boy, and worried about what I <br>
  was to do.<br>
  Conall stepped from the trees, cradling a girl shaped bundle wrapped head to toe in leaves and <br>
  flowers.<br>
  The body twitched.<br>
  Letting Breandan go, I set my two feet apart and spread my wings until the golden tips were in my <br>
  line of sight. They shone a brilliant gold, and felt glorious in the sunlight.<br>
  I readied myself for the day to come.</p>

  <h2 id="epil" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Epilogue</h2>
  <p class = "para1" id="1046" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">
  I ran. There was the forest, the gasp of my breath, and the pound of my mate's heartbeat as he <br>
  raced beside me. Nothing more. The forest, teeming with life hushed reverently as we blazed past, <br>
  in awe of us, in fear.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1047" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Devlin was less than a day ahead, and his trail was erratic. Appearing suddenly then becoming <br>
  deceptively faint, or weaving in odd directions. It was clear he was trying to throw us of course, <br>
  using magics and distractions to slow us down so he could escape. Each time I was sure he had <br>
  changed course or had gone another way, Conall had disagreed and pointed out the way. At times we <br>
  had to stop so he could read the trails, listen to the wind and press his ear to the earth.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1048" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I hummed with passion. Hate. I wanted Devlin's head on a pike. I wanted to dance manically around <br>
  his corpse, and give in to the dark whispers in the corners of my heart.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1049" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">We begun the hunt as the dew from the dawn soaked into the understory. I had left my vampire-boy, <br>
  Tomas, slumbering in the earthen tomb I had made to keep him safe. He was dead, and would not rise <br>
  until the sunset. I was pleased, because it meant I could focus on the task at hand. Catching <br>
  Devlin, getting the grimoire and ripping his heart out before Breandan, my life-mate, could stop <br>
  me.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1050" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Irritated and grumpy I waited, hand on hip for Conall to tell us which direction to take. I <br>
  plucked a few leaves from the mess of inky-black that was my hair, and felt Breandan come up behind <br>
  me. His hands gently rested on my shoulders then slid down my bared back to pass over my wings. <br>
  They twitched and fluttered at his touch. He continued, lazily wandering to my waist then lower, <br>
  gripping my hips.</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1051" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Focus,” I said, and thumped him lightly on the back of his thigh with my tail. “I'm trying to <br>
  relax you. You're too wound up and ready to break.”<br>
  “I want this over with. I want him dead.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1052" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">He sighed and muttered, “This is not going to end well.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1053" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1054" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">I twisted round to look him in the face, unsure of what he meant. He looked at Conall and his lips <br>
  pressed into a thin line. Breandan was skilled at schooling his expression, and I had to watch him <br>
  closely to see if he was mad, pissed or upset. I was going for mad.<br>
  “What?” I asked, because it became apparent he'd realized something before I had. I stepped out of <br>
  his arms and he let me. “What are you both not saying?”<br>
  I looked to Conall, the mighty warrior who was strong enough to massacre a small army of his kind. <br>
  He glowed, brighter than any other I had seen, except when Breandan and I were suffering the <br>
  effects of our bond. Conall was beautiful, a face of hard angles and smooth planes. His eyes were <br>
  gold, a family trait it seemed, since mine were the same, only lighter. His muscled chest heaved <br>
  with a sigh.<br>
  “The trail has gone cold.” I stared at him.<br>
  “You're lying.” Even as I said the words I flushed, but kept my stare defiant. Conall could not <br>
  lie. Fairies could not lie, except for me. They were bound to speak nothing but the truth by magic. <br>
  A fairies word once given was law.<br>
  Conall ignored the comment, flicked his hand through the air as if brushing his hurt aside. “It is <br>
  beyond me. Devlin has worked a spell. There are three different trails, each are cold and each <br>
  carry his and Wasp's scent. Less than an hour ago we were half a day away and gaining. Now, it <br>
  seems we are days behind and losing more time. It is a trick, a spell and I cannot see past it.”<br>
  “Then we follow each trail. One each.” “No,” Breandan said.<br>
  “Apart from the fact it would be most unwise to leave you alone, Rae,” Conall said patiently, “what <br>
  happens when one of us does find them? Or maybe we will find more false trails that we cannot <br>
  navigate alone.”<br>
  “Then we follow each one,” I said through my teeth. “We pick the most likely, follow for a while, <br>
  and if we're wrong we'll backtrack and start again until we get it right.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1055" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1056" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“And what of the time we lose whilst doing this? What if we come across more false trails? We could <br>
  spend days going in the wrong direction.”<br>
  I opened my mouth to tell him I was ready to spend my lifetime hunting Devlin. Then I saw the <br>
  stupidity in such words and my shoulders slumped. I burrowed the toe of my boot into the needle <br>
  leaf strewn around me. Tears threatened to spill from my eyes. My voice was thick when I said, <br>
  “There must be another way. We can't just give up. Not just for my rev-sake. Lochlann needs the <br>
  grimoire before he can start setting things right, doesn't he.”<br>
  Even if Conall would not give into a selfish endeavourer, such was the nature of revenge; he was <br>
  the most loyal warrior I knew. He would do anything to secure Lochlann the fairy-lordship because <br>
  he believed it was the right thing to do.<br>
  I looked up and found Breandan glaring at my brother, who sent him a short look of apology.<br>
  “There is something else we may consider. It is not without its dangers.” “It is not a good idea,” <br>
  Breandan said.<br>
  My tears were gone. Straightening, I cocked my head and tried to look attentive and brave, not <br>
  desperate to crack some skulls. “Tell me and I'll do it.”<br>
  “The shifters.”<br>
  My nipped intake of breath was loud in the sudden silence. “Yes,” I hissed, new possibilities <br>
  opening up like a carnivorous black hole before me. “A pack of were-cats could read each trail and <br>
  save us time. Which is the closest?”<br>
  “Byron's pack is close and of the Alfa's he is the most civilized.” “You both forget I have already <br>
  said no.”<br>
  Breandan sent me a pointed look that told me he was serious. I returned it with some extra ‘I'm <br>
  doing this so back the hell off’. I won, of course. He would not dare deny me this.<br>
  “Lead the way, big bro.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1057" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)"></p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1058" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">Conall grimaced. “My title would do if you wish to call me something other than my birth name.”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1059" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“Huh? What title?”</p>
  
  <p class = "para1" id="1060" ondblclick="add_bookMark(this.id)">“As the oldest surviving member of our family, you may call me Elder.” “Na, big bro is fine.”<br>
  Breandan laughed. It seemed the sun shone brighter, and his smile made me<br>
  blink.<br>
  Conall muttered something about fools in love and took off. I followed close behind, and Breandan <br>
  reached out the same moment as I did, to join hands.</p>
